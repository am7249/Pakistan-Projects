Mr. Speaker,
1. As I rise to present the 4th Budget of our Government, the Prime
Minister and the Leader of the House is recovering very fast after undergoing
surgery. Prayers of this House, entire nation and millions people from around
the world are with him for his speedy recovery so that he can come back and
take charge of the country’s leadership.
Mr. Speaker,
2. When we remember the economic challenges that were faced in June
2013, and the journey we had passed in the past three years under the
leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, we thank the blessings of Allah
bestowed upon us, Alhamdolilah, the dangers faced to the economy are over,
and the country is on the path to stability and growth. Those who had
predicted Pakistan’s default by June 2014 have been defeated. We have not
only prevented the country from economic default, but also have stabilized the
economy. Today international organisations are taking Pakistan’s name with
respect.
Mr. Speaker
3. We had a well-defined response for this purpose, which we had
articulated in our Manifesto before the 2013 general elections on the basis of
which we won the national elections. Our challenge was to put them in action
and diligently remain on course until their fruits were borne. We have done 
Budget Speech 2016-17
2
precisely this and have not only prevented default but have solidly stabilized
the economy and reinvigorated growth. Today, Allah has honored us to
present the 4th Budget of the country and in every budget we have done better
than the previous one and all economic indicators testify to this claim.
Comparative Economic Performance 2012-13 vs. 2015-16
Mr. Speaker:
4. I would like to place before this august House the following key
economic indicators, based on 9 or 10 months data or projected for the full
current fiscal year (2015-16) in comparison with the situation that existed in a
similar period or at the close of FY2013 or at End-June 2013:
1) Economic Growth, in the past two years has remained above
4% in the past two years, and during FY2015-16 has been
provisionally recorded at 4.71% which is highest in the previous
eight years. This performance could have been better if cotton
crop had not witnessed loss of 28% due to which national
economic growth was reduced by 0.5%.
2) Per Capita Income, which stood at $1334 in FY2012-13 is
projected to increase to $1561 in FY2015-16, showing a growth
of 17% in dollar terms, while it increased by 24% in terms of
rupee;
3) Inflation, which had averaged around 12% during the period
FY2008-13 before our government, was recorded at 7.4% in
FY2012-13. In the period Jul-May FY2016, the average inflation
was recorded at 2.82%, the lowest in a decade. This also means
that the revival in growth has not been accompanied by rise in
prices;
4) FBR Revenues had recorded an increase of merely 3.38% in
FY2012-13 when collections stood at Rs.1,946 billion. For the
current FY2015-16 the target of RS.3,104 billion has been fixed
and considering the collections to date, Inshallah this target will 
Budget Speech 2016-17
3
be achieved. This way tax revenues will be increased by 60%
which will be a historic increase. The tax to GDP ratio for FBR
taxes that was 8.5% in FY2012-13 has been increased to 10.5%
in FY2015-16.
5) Fiscal Deficit was 8.2% of GDP in FY2012-13 is being brought
down to 4.3% of GDP in FY2015-16;
6) Credit to Private Sector that was negative Rs.19 billion in
FY2012-13 has reached Rs.312 billion till May of current fiscal
year;
7) Policy Rate of SBP was 9.5% in May 2013, which has now
been brought down to 5.75% as on May 2016 which is lowest
rate in the past four decades.
8) Exports were $20.5 billion during Jul-Apr FY2012-13. Against
this, exports for the same period in FY2015-16 were recorded at
$18.2 showing a decline of 11%. The main reason for this
decline is global commodity prices.
9) Imports were recorded at $33.0 billion during Jul-Apr FY2012-
13 compared to $32.7 billion for the same period in FY2015-16.
Savings in the import bill of oil were nearly 40% but we diverted
these savings to increased imports of machinery and industrial
raw materials, thus enabling more growth oriented activities. The
imports of machinery over the last three years have increased
by a cumulative growth of 40%, which is again an indication of
rising investment in the economy;
10) Remittances were recorded at $11.6 billion during Jul-Apr
FY2012-13, which have risen to $16.0 billion for the same period
in this fiscal year FY2015-16, For the current year target is $19
billion for which efforts of devoted Pakistani overseas workers
and professionals are admirable.
11) Exchange Rate has shown remarkable stability in the last three
years. Against Rs.99.66/$ in June 2013, the exchange rate is
currently at 104.70/$. For an economy like Pakistan, Exchange
Rate has a pivotal position, as it impacts pervasively on all other
variables. The exchange rate stability we have achieved has not 
Budget Speech 2016-17
4
been witnessed in recent years and is a source of rebuilding the
credibility of our economy;
12) Foreign Exchange Reserves were in a precarious level of $6
billion with the SBP in June 2013, that after payment of past
liabilities and swaps were reduced to worrying some level of
$2.8 billion. These have increased to $16.8 billion by end May.
Including reserves with commercial banks have $4.8 billion,
Alhamdolilah, the level of $21.6 billion has been achieved, which
is a new historic record. And this way we have guarded the
economy from frequent external fluctuations;
13) Current Account Deficit: In the last three-year, we have kept
average current deficit to a very low level of 1% of GDP.
14) Stock Exchange (KSE) Index stood at 19,916 on 11 May 2013,
has now surged to above 36,000. In the same period, market
capitalization has increased from Rs.5.2 trillion to Rs.7.391
trillion and from $51.3 billion to $70.5 billion. The merger of
Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad stock exchanges, that was
pending for the past 15 years, was completed on 11th January
2016. It is expected that in the near future Pakistan’s stock
exchange will be part of the emerging markets.
5. This brief review clearly demonstrates that we have not only achieved
solid macroeconomic stability, but the country has been put on to a path of
growth. International organisations, economic experts as well as world’s
leading publications have lauded Government’s performance. Therefore, with
Allah’s blessings we remain committed to economic growth and this budget
will reflect our commitment.
Main Elements of Budget Strategy
Mr. Speaker
6. The main elements of our budget strategy are as follows:
Budget Speech 2016-17
5
1) Reduction of fiscal deficit: In FY2016-17 we will target a
deficit of 3.8% compared to 4.3% in FY2015-16;
2) Improvement in fiscal discipline: We are furthering advantages
derived from reduction of fiscal deficit. In 2016-17 the fiscal
deficit will be reduced from 4.3% to 3.8% of GDP. Through
amendment in Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act
2005 we are about to undertake two deep-rooted reforms in our
fiscal management system. First, we are putting a statutory limit
on the deficit of the federal government. Starting 2017-18, in
three years the federal deficit would be brought down to 4% of
GDP and thereafter to 3.5%. Second, the Debt to GDP ratio
would be brought down to 60% of GDP in the next two years
and then over a 15 years period it would be brought down to
50%;
3) Raising Tax Revenues: Part-II of the speech will deal with tax
proposals. At this stage, however, I would say that the proposed
reduction in deficit will be achieved through a combination of
better tax collection and tight expenditure controls;
4) Continued Focus on Energy: Energy has been our focus from
the start. The country was facing a dreadful energy crisis in June
2013. We formulated short, solid policies to avert this crisis on
permanent basis due to which considerable reduction in load
shedding. Today load shedding is being carried out
systematically. Implementation as the plan formulated by the
Cabinet committee formed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s will
result in 10,000 MW of additional electricity to be added in the
national grid by March 2018. Beyond March 2018 Inshallah,
Dasu, Diamer-Bhasha, Karachi Civil Nuclear Energy and many
other projects will also be completed besides coal-based
projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
5) Exports Promotion: In this budget, we would be announcing
additional measures to incentivize exports and taking other
initiatives to ease the cost of doing business and improving the
overall regulatory regime to facilitate exporters. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
6
6) Poverty and Unemployment: One major outcome of our
economic policies has been the reduction in poverty and
unemployment, both in the rural and urban areas. The recently
published poverty report compiled with the support of World
Bank, based on the Pakistan Social and Living Standard
Measurement (PLSM), based on cost of basic needs, indicates
that poverty has been reduced from around 64.2% in 2001-02 to
29.5% in 2014. Based on food energy intake the poverty during
this period has reduced from 34.6% to 9.31%. Similarly,
unemployment has also been reduced from 6.2% in 2012-13 to
5.9% in 2014-15;
7) Income Support Program (BISP): This program is an effort to
provide relief to the poor and weak segments of the society as a
matter of our responsibility and their right. The following have
been the main highlights under this program:
i. From Rs.40 billion in FY2012-13, we have progressively
increased the size of the program to Rs.102 billion during
the current year. We are further enhancing this allocation to
Rs.115 billion, representing a nearly three-fold increase
since 2012-13;
ii. By End-June 2013, the cash transfer program was covering
3.7 million families, which will be increased to 5.3 million by
the close of June 2016. By the end of next financial year the
number of beneficiary families would further rise to increase
to 5.6 million;
iii. The stipend under the program in 2013 was a mere
Rs.12,000 annually, which had been set in 2008. During the
last three year we have increased the stipend to Rs.18,800;
iv. Budget for Bait-ul-Maal has been increased from Rs.2 billion
to Rs.4 billion.
8) Development & Promotion of ICT Sector:- A number of
initiatives were announced in the last budget for the
development of promotion Information and Communication 
Budget Speech 2016-17
7
Technology (ICT). These initiatives have been operationalized
with the following key features:
• Rural Telephony & E-Services (RTEs) Program: To
extend IT and Telephone services to far-flung areas four new
projects were started in 2016-17 under Universal Services
Fund. A part of this project in Balochistan, Kharaan, Washuk,
Dera Bugti, Kohistan and in FATA Warisistan areas, new
lines for Rs.2.43 billion are being laid in these areas. For ongoing projects Rs.9.52 billion will be allocated. In 2016-17 for
provision of telephone services in rural areas an amount of
Rs.11.94 billion have been allocated.
• Broadband Program: The ongoing Broadband projects in
Southern Telecom Region are expected to provide coverage
to over 56,000 new subscribers in un-served/underserved
areas in FY 2016-17. Furthermore, 125 Educational
Broadband Centers (EBC’s) and 55 Community Broadband
Centers (CBC’s) are to be established under these projects
with subsidy of 482.5 million.
• Optic Fiber Cable Program: Under this scheme in FY2016-
17 Rs.63.4 million have been allocated for on-going projects
in Balochistan and Rs.1.9 billion for three new projects in
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab;
• Other than the above, work on; establishment of computer
labs under Pakistan Bait ul Maal women empowerment
centres, Prime Minister’s Information and Communication
Technology scholarship, Prime Minister’s scholarship
program for talented students of Balochistan and Prime
Minister’s National ICT internship program, is underway. For
the current year 2016-17 around Rs.1 billion will be spent on
these schemes.
• Construction of Cross-Border Optic Fiber System
between China and Pakistan: Only recently the Prime
Minister has inaugurated the establishment of cross-border 
Budget Speech 2016-17
8
optic fiber project which will further open relations between
the two countries.
Medium-term macroeconomic framework
Mr. Speaker
7. As always, our budget strategy is embedded in a three year medium
term macroeconomic framework spanning the period 2016-19, the main
features of which are as follows:
1) GDP growth to gradually rise to 7.0% by FY2018-19;
2) Inflation will be contained to single digit;
3) Investment to GDP ratio will rise to 21% at the end of medium
term;
4) Fiscal deficit would be brought to down to 3.5% of GDP;
5) Tax to GDP ratio will be increased to 13.9%;
6) Foreign exchange reserves would reach $30 billion,
inshaAllah.
8. In our view, this is a realistic macroeconomic framework given the
performance we have rendered in the last three years.
Development plan
Mr. Speaker
9. The past history of adjustments and reforms in Pakistan is replete with
the common phenomenon of cutting the development expenditures to control
fiscal deficit. Our Government has succeeded in breaking out from this cycle,
as the fiscal discipline we have achieved is without sacrificing development
spending. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
9
10. At the close of the third year of our Government, the development
expenditure would increase from Rs.348 billion to Rs.661 billion and in
FY2016-17 the target is Rs.800 billion.
11. The development plan is geared towards developing human and social
capital of the country by enabling universal access to education and health
facilities, empowering women and eradicating poverty; thereby capitalizing the
demographic dividend and increasing the total factor productivity.
12. For development process Public Private Partnership policy has been
prepared. For this purpose, transport, communications, financial, and
industries and services have been identified. To enhance their share in the
GDP a comprehensive strategy has been formulated.
13. In addition to increasing the public Investment, concerted efforts are
being made to entice the private investment through a variety of mechanisms
such as promoting public private partnerships, FDI, creating special economic
zones with fiscal incentives.
14. I would now present some highlights of the development budget,
focusing mainly on the sectors that will contribute most to economic
development.
Water
15. As usual, one of the key sectors claiming significant resources is the
water sector, where we are investing Rs.32 billion for projects in various parts
of the country. Other than these allocations, a project that will be the future
lifeline of Pakistan is the Diamir Bhasha Dam, which will store 4.7 MAF of
water and generate electricity of 4500 MW. We have provided Rs.32 billion for
the project. Another important hydropower project is Dasu, which will have the 
Budget Speech 2016-17
10
capacity to generate 2160 MW in phase 1. We have allocated Rs.42 billion
for phase 1 of Dasu Hydro Power Project.
16. Water projects in Balochistan are the second most important focus of
water sector investments comprising construction of delay action dams, flood
dispersal structures, canals and small storage dams. Main focus will be on the
existing projects that can be completed within the next 2 years. In this regard,
work is in advanced stages on projects such as Kachhi Canal (DeraBugti and
Nasirabad), Naulong Storage Dam (JhalMagsi), extension of Pat Feeder
Canal to DeraBugti and ShadiKaur Dam (Gawadar). Recently work on Basool
Dam in Gawadar has also started. This year an amount of Rs.300 million has
been allocated for further advancing the project of construction of 100 small
dams.
17. Similarly, in Sindh, projects that are advancing gradually are Rainee
Canal (Ghotki and Sukkur), extension of Right Bank Outfall Drain from
Sehwan to sea, and Darwat Dam. In Punjab construction of Papin Dam in
Rawalpindi will commence. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, other than Dasu, funds
will be provided for construction of small dams in district Mansehra, and a
sizeable project of Chashma Right Bank Canal – 1st Life Cum Gravity will
begin. In FATA funding for Kurram Tangi in North Waziristan, and Gomal Zam
Dam in South Waziristan will continue.
18. Besides, numerous schemes of lining of water-courses will be
undertaken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Punjab to reduce water
wastage together with flood protection and drainage schemes all over the
country.
Power
19. I have already explained how intensely we are committed to alleviate
the problems of the energy sector. We have taken a number of steps to 
Budget Speech 2016-17
11
address structural problems of the sector including reduction in system
losses, improvement in recoveries, elimination of theft and settlement of inter
corporate circular debt. However, our real focus is on developing additional
resources of energy so as to permanently overcome energy shortages.
20. As in the past, we have allocated the largest amount of resources to
add new and economical capacity in the national grid. During the current year
a sum of Rs.380 billion will be invested in this sector up from Rs.287 billion
allocated in last year’s budget. Of this, Rs.130 billion will come from the PSDP
this year as compared to Rs.112 billion allocated last year.
21. Large projects, other than Dasu and Diamir-Bhasha, that are part of
this year’s allocation include:
(a) Rs.61 billion have been allocated for Neelum Jhelum Hydro Power
Project having a capacity of 969 MW;
(b) Rs.16.5 billion have been allocated for completion of Tarbela-IV
Extension Hydro Power Project with a capacity of 1410 MW;
(c) Two LNG power plants in Baloki and Haveli Bahadurshah will be
allocated Rs.60 billion. Combined, the two power plants will
produce 2400-MW of electricity.
22. In addition, a number of other projects such as two Karachi Nuclear
Coastal Power Projects (2200 MW) with Chinese assistance; Chashma Civil
Nuclear Power project (600 MW); Golan Gol Hydro Power Project (106 MW);
Evacuation of power from wind power projects at Jhimpir and Gharo Wind
Clusters; Interconnection of Chashma Nuclear Power Plants III and IV are
also included in the plan.
23. The broad-based configuration of pipeline projects based as it is on a
number of hydel, coal, wind energy and nuclear fuels will correct the energy
mix to provide cheap electricity to the people of Pakistan, while improvement 
Budget Speech 2016-17
12
of the transmission and distribution system will reduce the system losses.
Steps against electricity theft will reduce burden on the common citizens.
Highways
24. Pakistan’s location is such that it can play a central role in regional
connectivity. In order to maximally exploit the natural advantage of its
geography and to translate it into economic gains, there is an imperative need
to invest in communication infrastructure. Accordingly, we have allocated
Rs.188 billion for construction of roads, highways and bridges which is an
increase of about 18% as compared to last year.

25. An area of our priority in the highways sector is the completion of
Lahore-Karachi Motorway. We firmly believe that this highway will change the
fate of this country. It will provide jobs, farm-to-road connectivity and
economic growth in Pakistan. In the Budget 2016-17, we have allocated
Rs.34 billion for Lahore-Abdul Hakeem Section, which is about 230 kilometers
long. Similarly, an allocation of Rs.19 billion has been provided for MultanSukkar Section (387 kilometers), whereas in order to complete the SukkurHyderabad Section (296 kilometers), a provision of Rs.2.5 billion has been
made in the PSDP. This project is being executed in collaboration with private
sector.
26. Apart from completion of various segments of Karachi-Lahore
Motorway, we have made allocations to start work on other section of China
Pakistan Economic Corridor. Furthermore, work on 118 KM Thakot-Havelian
link is underway, and this year we will allocate Rs.16.5 billion. For the
construction of Burhan-Hakla on M-1 to Dera Ismail Khan, a total of Rs.22
billion will be allocated.
27. We have earmarked resources for numerous projects in Highways
sector in this budget. Some of them are: Faisalabad-Khanewal Expressway, 
Budget Speech 2016-17
13
Lowari Tunnel and Access Roads, Qila Saifullah Lora Lai Waigum Road, and
Zhob Mughal Kot Road.
Railways
28. Railway is supposed to provide cheaper, faster and convenient mode
of passenger and freight transport. Accordingly, its development is one of our
important priorities.
29. Newly launched Green Line train express between Islamabad and
Karachi is the result of efforts of the Railways Ministry. However, this is the
beginning of a bright future. Pakistan Railways will target its investments
around locomotives, bogies, tracks, signaling systems, and improvement of
existing railway stations.
30. For the current year’s budget the following projects will be our key
priority:
1) Track rehabilitation project between Khanpur and Lodhran is
progressing. This year we aim to start work on doubling /
improvement of existing track from Port Qasim to Bin Qasim
Station. This is an important CPEC project.
2) Pakistan Railways faces shortage of locomotives and for this
reason, we have allocated Rs.14 billion for the procurement /
manufacture of new locomotive engines. In addition,
rehabilitation of rolling stock will also continue.
3) Repair work on around 800 coaches and 2000 wagons will be
completed by this year.
31. In this budget, we have allocated Rs.78 billion, of which Rs.41 billion
are in PSDP for 40 development schemes and Rs.37 billion for pay & 
Budget Speech 2016-17
14
pensions of railway employees. Private and international investments are
expected during the course of the financial year in this sector, as well.
Human Development
32. People are the most precious resources of any nation. Therefore we
consider the expenditures on human development as investments as they lay
the foundation of future growth at an accelerated pace.
33. Initiatives that will be undertaken for the promotion of this sector are as
follows:
1) A allocation of Rs.21.5 billion has been made for 122 projects of
the Higher Education Commission, which will support
development plans of different universities all over the country. It
may be noted that on the current side also a hefty allocation of
Rs.58 billion is made for HEC. Thus a combined outlay of
Rs.79.5 billion will be made for higher education. The combined
allocation represents about 11% increase.
2) Health sector service delivery has been fully devolved to the
provincial governments. As per the decision taken by the
Council of Common Interests in 2010, the Federal Government
continued to support the provincial Governments till this year for
the national health and population welfare programs. This year
the Federal Govt will allocate Rs.22.4 billion for the vertical
health programs. Implementation of Prime Minister’s National
Health Insurance Program will continue.
Temporary Displaced Persons (TDPs) and Security Enhancement:
Special Development Program
Budget Speech 2016-17
15
Mr. Speaker
34. The operation Zarb-e-Azb has been successful and highly effective in
stemming the continuing threat to country’s peace and integrity.
Consequently, the law and order situation in the country has improved and
investors’ confidence, both domestic and foreign, is gradually rising. This has
been made possible through self-less devotion of our valiant Armed Forces,
who have made great sacrifices in eradicating open sanctuaries terrorists.
They deserve the gratitude of the nation. The Temporary Displaced People
(TDPs) from the areas of operation were hosted in the mainland. Now their
transfer and rehabilitation is underway. However, this process would take
some time before completion.
35. To cater for the needs of hosting, rehabilitation and the return of TDPs
and security enhancement a Special Development Program of Rs.100 billion
has been provided in the budget FY2015-16.
China-Pak Economic Corridor (CPEC)
36. CPEC is a historic scheme that will start a new age between Pakistan
and China and will enable both of the countries to extended connectivity with
various other countries of the world
37. Under this scheme, $46 billion investment will be made under various
schemes that include building of roads and rail networks and
telecommunications, development of Gwadar Port and major projects for
additional power and improvement in power transmission sub-sector. This will
result in economic improvement of economies of the four provinces and
special areas of Pakistan. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
16
Development of Gawadar
38. Keeping in view the significant role Gawadar has to play for
strengthening the economy of Pakistan in the coming days, the government
takes the development of this area very seriously. Accordingly, we are
allocating significant resources for a host of development projects aimed at
uplift of this area.
SPECIAL INITIATIVES FOR 2016-17
Mr. Speaker
39. After achieving macro-economic stability in past three years, it is our
duty that we must further consolidate the achievements and accelerate the
reforms in sectors that have been left behind. For this I announce the
following measures:
Export Promotion
40. Pakistan’s export potential has not been fully realised due to depressed
commodity prices and slowdown in major export markets. In order to
strengthen exports and remove bottlenecks faced by our exporters, I
announced a number of measures in my previous budget speech. These
included:
1) Approval of strategic medium-term trade policy framework;
2) Establishment of Export-Import Bank – also known as the Exim
Bank;
3) Drawback on local taxes and levies to the tune of Rs.1.4 billion; and,
4) Reduction of mark-up rates on Export Refinance Facility and LongTerm Finance Facility. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
17
41. In order to increase exports the following measures are being made
this year – FY2016-17:-
1) To operationalize the trade policy, a total of Rs.6 billion have been
allocated in the budget;
2) The existing scheme on Drawback of Local Taxes (DLTL) will
continue in the FY2016-17;
3) The mark-up rates on Export Refinance Facility, which was 9.5% in
June 2013 will be brought down to 3.0% from 1st July 2016;
4) To encourage Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to invest in
new technologies especially in non-traditional exports, a Technology
Upgradation Fund (TUF) is being established;
5) Zero-rating of Export Oriented Sectors: The export of manufactured
goods in Pakistan comes from five main sectors - textile, leather,
sports goods, surgical goods and carpets. For encouragement of
these five sectors, from 1st July 2016 they will be made part of zerorated tax regime;
6) The zero-rating facility will be available on purchase of raw
materials, intermediate goods and the purchase of energy i.e.
electricity, gas, furnace oil and coal. The retail sales of locally
manufactured finished goods of these sectors will continue to be
subjected to sales tax @5%.
7) All the pending sales tax refunds till 30th April whose RPOs have
been approved, will be paid by 31st August 2016.
Budget Speech 2016-17
18
Textile Sector
Mr. Speaker,
42. Textile sector is the primary manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In order
to further enhance the export competitiveness of this sector the following
measures are proposed in Budget FY2016-17:
1) The existing scheme on Drawback of Local Taxes (DLTL) will
continue in the FY2016-17;
2) Technology Up-gradation Fund: Technology Up-gradation Fund
(TUF) Scheme for the textile sector has been formulated which will
be implemented from July 1st, 2016. This scheme will particularly
benefit the SMEs to invest in new technologies to make Pakistan’s
exports globally competitive;
3) Duty Free Import of Machinery: The benefit of SRO 809, through
which textile machinery can be imported duty free, will continue for
FY2016-17 and scope would be widened to include more garment
specific machinery. This incentive, along with LTFF and TUF, would
encourage new investment in textile sector to increase exports;
4) Withdrawal of Customs Duty on Manmade Fibers:
Concessionary customs duty on the man-made fibers that are not
manufactured locally will continue.
5) Plant Breeders Right Act: One of the top priorities of the
government is to ensure provision of quality seeds to growers. For
this purpose, it is important to honor scientists with intellectual
property rights of varieties they develop. The draft law is ready which
will be implemented after approval of the Parliament.
REVIVAL OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Mr. Speaker,
Budget Speech 2016-17
19
43. Agriculture is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy as it provides direct
employment to 44% of the labor force and contributes 21% in the GDP.
Agriculture also provides 70% of the raw material for textile industry. National
food security is also dependent on agriculture. Therefore, enhancing
agriculture sector performance is central to increasing GDP, enhancing
industrial productivity and income of rural population.
44. Due to higher inventories, declining commodity prices and
unfavourable weather conditions, agriculture sector has suffered very badly.
All of this has resulted in significant erosion of farm incomes. To enhance
agriculture productivity, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a historic
package in September 2015 for Rs.341 for less expensive fertilizer, seeds,
loans and availability of water. Key features of the package included:
1) Direct cash support to the tune of Rs.40 billion;
2) Subsidy of Rs.20 billion on urea – which reduced the prices of DAP
by Rs.500 per bag;
3) Subsidy on import of urea to keep the prices low;
4) Concessional electricity tariff for agriculture Tubewells.

Government has decided to take further special steps in the current financial
year. Details are as under:-
1) Concessions of taxes and duties: Tax and duty concessions
announced in Budget 2015-16 will continue in 2016-17. These
concessions amount to Rs.15 billion and are expected to
promote agriculture sector development,
2) Reduction in prices of fertilizer: Fertilizer is a major input cost
in the agriculture sector. In the past few months, through the
provision of gas to fertilizer industry, the Government reduced 
Budget Speech 2016-17
20
prices of urea fertilizer from Rs.2050 to Rs.1800 per bag.
Consultations of Government with fertilizer industry have
resulted in further decrease of Rs.50 per bag. From 1st July
2016, the Government has decided that the price of urea is
further reduced to Rs.1400 per bag. In this instance, just as in
the past, the Federal and Provincial Governments will pay the
cost of the subsidy, which will be Rs.36 billion, in equal shares.
Similarly, use of DAP is very important for improving agriculture
productivity. The current price of DAP is Rs.2800 per bag.
Consultations of Government with fertilizer industry have
resulted in further decrease of Rs.50 per bag. In this instance,
the Government has decided that with effect from 1st July 2016,
the price per bag of DAP will be Rs.2500. In this instance, just
as in the past, the Federal and Provincial Governments will pay
the cost of the subsidy, which will be Rs.10 billion, in equal
shares.
3) Enhancement in the target of agriculture credit: Availability
of credit facilities to farmers especially the small farmers is one
of the priority areas of this Government. Over the last three
years volume of agriculture credit is being increased from
Rs.336 billion to Rs.600 billion. For 2016-17 volume of
agriculture credit target is being increased to Rs.700 billion.
4) Reduction of cost of credit: The Government through SBP

farmers by guaranteeing up to 50% of the financing by
participating financial institutions. The small farmers have shown
overwhelming interest in this scheme. Accordingly, the
Government is allocating Rs.1 billion in 2016-17.

FINANCIAL SECTOR
Mr. Speaker,
48. In the recent years in our financial sectors has demonstrated a good
performance. In the current financial year till March, the total assets of this
sector stood at Rs.14,300 billion which were Rs.12,100 billion in the previous
year. This sector’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was 16.3% while its legal
requirement was only 10.25% that reflects strong capital base. To further
strengthen the financial sector in the country, the following measures are
being taken:
1) Financial Institutions Secured Transactions Bill 2016 through
which loans related charge on moveable assets can be created;
2) Deposit protection Bill 2016 through which small depositors will

several ailments. During 2015-18 around Rs.9 billion premium will be paid
through this scheme. Initially the scheme will be started in 23 districts of
Pakistan. It will be gradually increased to cover all the poorest segment of
society. Alongside the program, soft loans are being offered to the
empanelled hospitals for up gradation of their medical facilities. Through these
soft loans, the empanelled hospitals will focus more on improving health
services including maternal and child health. The loans will be provided at
subsidized rates through provision of mark up subsidy and sharing in credit
risk.

Prime Minister’s Special Schemes

Nawaz Sharif following key schemes were started:-
1) Prime Minister’s Youth Business Loan Scheme;

Students;
4) Prime Minister’s Fee Reimbursement Scheme for Students of
Less Developed Areas;

is satisfactory. In the current financial year 2015-16, expenditure of Rs.19
billion was incurred. For the next financial year 2016-17 an outlay of Rs.20
billion has been allocated for these schemes. All of the schemes will be made
operational.
Gender Responsive Budgeting
52. The Government is committed to developing and implementing policies
and measures to enhance the socio-economic empowerment of women.
Budget allocations are one of the major instruments to strengthen women
empowerment. In this regard, we have also introduced a reform agenda. We
have started the implementation of Gender Responsive Budgeting at the
federal level. In this activity, we are inviting the provincial governments to be
part of this reforms, which after the 18th Constitutional amendment are
responsible for those functions where women have more opportunities for
example, education and health. 
Budget Speech 2016-17

Budget Estimates
Mr. Speaker,
53. Now I turn towards the estimates of revenues and expenditures for the
next fiscal year.
54. Gross revenue receipts of the federal government for 2016-17 are
estimated at Rs.4,915 billion compared to the revised figures of Rs.4,332
billion for 2015-16, showing an increase of 13.5%. We have set an ambitious
target for tax collections, as without collecting more taxes we cannot hope to
increase development spending that is crucial for economic growth.
55. The share of provincial governments out of these taxes will be
Rs.2,136 billion compared to Rs.1,852 billion revised estimates for 2015-16,
showing an increase of about 15.3%. For the year 2016-17, net resources left
with the federal government will be Rs.2,781 billion compared to the revised
estimates of Rs.2,481 billion for 2015-16, showing an increase of 12.1%.
Federal Government recognizes that the provincial governments have
increased responsibilities of social sector service delivery under the new
arrangements. Therefore, we are consistently raising the level of provincial
transfers to enable them to improve the social services and law and order for
the people of Pakistan.
56. Total expenditure for 2016-17, is budgeted at Rs.4,395 billion
compared to the revised estimates of Rs.4,095 billion for 2015-16, showing an
increase of 7.3%. By increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the
economy has strengthened.
57. The current expenditure is estimated at Rs.3,400 billion for 2016-17
against a revised estimate of Rs.3,282 billion for 2015-16, showing an
increase of 3.6%. However, we have catered for the needs of the Armed 
Budget Speech 2016-17
28
Forces keeping in view the security challenges. The defense budget is being
increased from the Rs.776 billion for 2015-16 (Revised) to Rs.860 billion for
2016-17, which is an increase of about 11%.
58. The development budget has been adequately funded in order to meet
the investment requirements of a growing economy. Against a revised
estimate of Rs.661 billion for PSDP during 2015-16 (Revised) for 2016-17 we
have budgeted Rs.800 billion showing an increase of nearly 21%. This also
includes the Special Development Program for security enhancement as well
as for rehabilitation and resettlement of TDPs as I have explained earlier.
59. As I said earlier, we are targeting to reduce it further to 4.3% for the
current year, and 3.8% for the year 2016-17.
PART-II
Mr. Speaker,
60. I have already placed before the house, in earlier part of the speech,
the tax relief and growth measures that have been proposed for the different
sectors of the economy.
61. Now I shall place before the House further relief and tax measures that
are proposed to be introduced in the current Budget starting with income tax
measures.
INCOME TAX
RELIEF MEASURES:
62. Rationalizing Corporate Tax Rate- As per government policy and in
order to encourage corporatization, corporate tax rates are being reduced by
1% each year starting from 35% in TY 2013 and coming down to 30% in TY
2018. The corporate tax rate will be 31% for TY 2017.
Budget Speech 2016-17
29
63. Tax Credit for Enlistment - At present 20% tax credit on tax payable
for enlistment in stock exchange is available for 1 year. In order to encourage
organized sector tax, credit is proposed to be made available for 2 years
instead of 1 year.
64. Enhancing limit of markup on house building loan - Presently, an
individual is allowed a deductable allowance up to Rs. 1 Million on payment of
profit on debt for construction of a new house or acquisition of house. In order
to promote activity in the housing sector to meet the deficiency of available
housing units, it is proposed to increase the maximum amount allowable from
Rs. 1 Million to 2 Million.
65. Relief on Education Expenses - In order to provide relief on
education expenses which are unbearable for low income groups, it is
proposed that individuals having taxable income less than Rs. 1 million should
be given tax relief equal to 5% of school fee up to Rs. 60,000 per child per
annum.
66. Tax Credit for Contribution to approved Pension Fund - At present
a tax credit is available for contribution in an approved Pension Fund with a
maximum of 20% taxable income. An additional contribution of 2% for
persons above 41 years of age to a maximum of 50% of taxable income is
available up to 30-06-2016. It is proposed that the period may be extended up
to 30-06-2019 with the condition that the maximum tax credit be restricted to
30% of taxable income of the preceding year.
67. Commission Income of Life Insurance Agents - Commission paid to
life insurance agents is taxed under final tax regime at the rate of 12% for
filers and 15% for non filers. To facilitate low income group it is proposed that
final tax rate on commission of life insurance agent may be reduced to 8% for
filers on commission receipts up to Rs. 0.5 M. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
30
68. Employers’ Annual Contribution in Provident Funds - Contribution
by an employer in Provident Fund up to one-tenth of salary of an employee or
Rs. 100,000, whichever is lower, is exempt. Any amount exceeding this limit is
treated as income of the employee. To provide relief to salaried taxpayers, the
limit of Rs. 100,000 on employer’s contribution is proposed to be enhanced to
Rs. 150,000.
EXEMPTION FROM LEVY OF MINIMUM TAX ON TURNOVER OF
TRADING HOUSES
Mr. Speaker,
69. Large Trading Houses were exempted from payment of minimum tax at
the rate of 1% during the first 10 years of commencement of business
operations. This exemption shall expire in June 2016. In order to incentivize
this organized section of the retail sector and to attract foreign investment, this
exemption is proposed to be gradually withdrawn and minimum Tax is
proposed to be reduced to 0.5% of the entire turnover up to TY 2019.
70. Reduced Rate of WHT U/S 152 on FMCG - Distributors of Fast
Moving Consumer Goods are operating at low profit margins and therefore
minimum tax u/s 113 is chargeable at reduced rate of 0.2%. However, FMCG
distributors are subject to normal rate of withholding tax on their supplies. For
distributors of FMCG, it is proposed to reduce WHT rate on supplies from 4%
to 3% for companies and from 4.5% to 3.5% for others. However no reduction
would be available for non-filers.
71. Minimum Tax on Corporate Service Providers - Through Finance
Act 2015, Minimum Tax at the rate of 8% was levied on corporate service
providers. Some Corporate service providers with low profit margin were
allowed a reduced tax rate of 2% for Tax Year 2016. It is proposed that
reduced tax rate of 2% allowed to low profit margin corporate service
providers for Tax Year 2016 may be extended for Tax Year 2017. In order to 
Budget Speech 2016-17
31
promote IT sector it is proposed that this concession may also be provided to
providers of IT and IT enabled services.
72. Taxation of property income as separate block - In order to facilitate
persons deriving income from renting of property including widows and senior
citizens taxation of property income in the case of individuals and associations
of persons is proposed to be simplified. It is proposed that for such persons
the property income may not be clubbed with income under other heads and
may be taxed as a separate block of income. Income up to Rs. 200,000 shall
be exempt and income up to Rs. 2,000,000 shall be taxed in slabs of 5%,
10% and 15%. Income above Rs. 2,000,000 shall be taxed at 20%.
Budget Speech 2016-17
32
REVENUE MEASURES:
Mr. Speaker,
73. I will now present the revenue measures proposed to be taken under
the Income Tax law.
74. Advance tax for alternate corporate tax - Advance tax is paid on the
basis of tax calculated on income and minimum tax on turnover and is
required to be deposited in four installments. However, advance tax is not
calculated on the basis of ACT. It is proposed that advance tax may also be
paid on the basis of ACT paid for Tax Year 2015 and for subsequent years.
This will not create any additional liability for the taxpayers and only
represents a change in collection methodology.
75. Rationalising Minimum Tax - Companies declaring Gross Loss are
exempt from payment of Minimum Tax at the rate of 1% of turnover. This
exemption is not applicable to Individuals and AOPs. In order to discourage
avoidance of tax and to bring uniformity in application of law, it is proposed to
withdraw exemption from minimum tax to companies declaring gross loss.
76. Rationalising Tax Rate for securities for non-filers - The stock
markets in Pakistan are booming and the investors are making
unprecedented gains. This sector is expected to make its due contribution to
the national exchequer. It is proposed that the maximum taxable holding
period for capital gain on securities may be extended from 4 to 5 years. In
order to encourage compliance with tax laws, it is also proposed that, for nonfilers, higher tax rates of 18%, 16% and 11% for holding period of up to 1
year, 2 years and 5 years respectively may be introduced.
77. Rationalising rates for capital gain tax on immovable property -
Investment in real estate sector is a means of earning huge gains. Our
government is attempting to integrate this sector gradually into the tax system.
At present, no tax is charged on capital gain from immovable property if it is 
Budget Speech 2016-17
33
sold after two years of acquisition. It is proposed that Capital Gain on disposal
of immovable properties be taxed at a rate of 10% if the property is sold within
five years of acquisition.
EXEMPTION TO PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA
Mr. Speaker,
78. The rate of withholding tax for providing or rendering services by
print and electronic media is 1%, whereas for others it ranges from 8-10% and
for low margin sectors it is up to 2%. It is proposed that in view of the peculiar
nature of the business of print and electronic media withholding tax for
providing or rendering services by print and electronic media be enhanced
from 1% to 1.5% and the withheld tax may be treated as the final tax in
respect of the income from these receipts. Concessionary rate of customs
duty on import of newsprint by newspapers and exemption from sales tax on
newsprint shall remain intact.
79. Withholding tax on profit from Term Finance Certificates for
companies - Profit on Term Finance Certificates is exempt from withholding
tax if paid to a company whereas the companies are required to pay tax on
their income at the time of filing of their return. It is proposed to withdraw this
exemption in order to streamline the collection of tax from this source.
EXEMPTION CERTIFICATE TO MANUFACTURERS ON IMPORT OF RAW
MATERIALS
Mr. Speaker,
80. Commercial importers have a grievance that facility of exemption
certificate is sometimes misused by manufacturers when they sell the raw
material imported for own consumption by availing the facility of exemption
certificates. To address this issue and to provide a level playing field it is 
Budget Speech 2016-17
34
proposed that manufacturers availing exemption certificate may be subjected
to compulsory audit of consumption, production and sales.
81. Extension in super tax - In the budget for the financial year 2015-16 a
tax on the income of the affluent and rich individuals, association of persons
and companies earning income above Rs. 500 million in tax year 2015 at a
rate of 4% of income for banking companies and 3% of income for all others
was levied. Since the circumstances that necessitated this measure are still
continuing, it is proposed to extend this measure by one year for Tax Year
2016.
82. Persons registered with provincial sales tax authorities - A large
number of persons are filing sales tax returns with the provincial revenue
authorities but are not filing income tax returns. It is proposed that such nonfilers may be required to pay advance income tax monthly, to be collected by
provincial revenue authorities along with sales tax returns, at the rate of 3% of
turnover.
83. Rationalizing of Withholding Tax on Transfer of Property - In order
to broaden the tax base and document transactions, withholding tax is
collected on sale of property and also from the purchaser of property if the
value of property is more than Rs. 3 million. However, the withholding tax on
sale and purchase is based on DC rates which are far lower than the actual
market prices and are not revised frequently to reflect increasing property
prices. It is proposed to increase the rate in case of sale of property from
0.5% and 1% to 1% and 2% for filers and non-filers respectively and in case
of purchase of property, from 1% and 2% to 2% and 4% for filers and nonfilers respectively.
84. Withholding tax on mining - Various minerals are being extracted in
all four provinces through licenses granted by the provincial governments.
Most of the non-corporate persons engaged in extracting minerals are non
filers. To broaden the tax net, it is proposed that Provincial Government 
Budget Speech 2016-17
35
authorities collecting royalties at the time of dispatch may also collect
withholding tax at the rate of 5% of the value of minerals.
RATIONALIZING TAX RATE ON DIVIDEND FOR NON-FILERS
Mr. Speaker,
85. In most of the countries dividend is taxed at normal rates so that there
is no adverse impact on the aggregate tax payable on the income of the
company. To narrow this gap in Pakistan and to encourage compliance with
tax laws it is proposed that, the rate of tax on dividend in the case of non-filers
may be increased from 17.5% to 20%. The tax withheld in excess of 12.5%
shall remain adjustable.
86. Rationalizing of WHT on electricity - Contribution of trading sector to
revenues is very low as compared to its share in GDP. Rate of WHT for
commercial bills up to Rs. 20,000 per month is fixed with various slabs. Rate
of WHT for commercial bills above Rs. 20,000 is 10%. ICAP and Pakistan
Business Council has recommended enhancing the rate of withholding tax for
commercial consumers. It is proposed to increase this rate to 12%. There will
be no change for industrial consumers.
87. Withholding tax on non-filer lessees of vehicles - Non-filers try to
avoid higher rate of tax for non-filers at the time of purchase and registration
of vehicle by getting vehicles leased from various banks, leasing companies
etc and the vehicles are registered in the name of the leasing company or
bank. To avoid this misuse, it is proposed that an adjustable withholding tax
at the rate of 3% of the value of vehicle be collected by every bank/leasing
company etc from non-filers at the time of lease.

88. Rationalizing tax rates for various sources of insurance
companies - In line with the one basket approach for banking companies
introduced last year, it is proposed that income of insurance companies from
all sources may also be subjected to same corporate tax rate.
Budget Speech 2016-17
36
89. Rationalizing WHT on commission of members of stock exchange
- Compared to high profit margins of stock brokers, the withholding tax rate of
0.01% withholding tax on commission of members of Stock Exchange is quite
low. It is proposed that it may be enhanced to 0.02%.
DIFFERENTIAL WITHHOLDING TAX RATES FOR NON-FILERS ON PRIZE
BONDS
Mr. Speaker,
90. Since prize bonds are bearer instruments, they are often used by tax
evaders and non-compliant persons to whiten their income. Therefore, it is
proposed to increase the withholding tax rate for non-filers from 15% to 20%
on winning of prize bonds.
91. Differential tax rates for non-filers on dividend from mutual funds
etc. - Non-filers are required to pay tax at higher rate on dividend. It is
proposed to introduce higher tax rates of 15% for non-filers receiving dividend
from Mutual Funds. The rate for filers shall remain unchanged at 10%. The
excess tax at 5% for non-filers shall be adjustable.
92. Taxation of Capital Gains from sale of securities representing
futures contracts - Through Finance Act, 2015 a transaction tax was levied
on trading of commodity futures contracts on Pakistan Mercantile Exchange
(PMEX). It is proposed that instead of tax on transaction, tax be levied at the
rate of 5% on actual capital gain as is being done for securities traded on
Stock Exchange.
93. Extending the scope of minimum tax - The undocumented sectors
of the economy, including retailers and small businesses, under-report their
income. In many cases declared income is below taxable limit. Consequently,
their contribution to revenue is much lower than their share in GDP. Currently
minimum tax at the rate of 1% of turnover in case of AOP and Individuals is 
Budget Speech 2016-17
37
applicable only where turnover is above Rs. 50 M. It is proposed that this limit
may be reduced to Rs. 10 M.
TAXATION OF BUILDERS & LAND DEVELOPERS
Mr. Speaker,
94. Bulk of the public savings are parked in housing sector and heavy
investments are made in real estate yet tax collection from this sector does
not match with level of investment and the profits earned. Association of
Builders and Developers has recommended that in order to bring this sector in
to tax net and to eliminate disputes a final tax regime may be devised for
builders and land developers. A final tax scheme on the basis of fixed tax per
unit area basis is proposed to be prescribed for builders and developers.\
95. Withholding tax on foreign produced TV plays and advertisements
etc - Through Finance Act 2013, a withholding tax was imposed on airing of
foreign produced TV plays and serials only on landing rights channels. In
order to encourage locally produced plays and to enable the local production
houses to compete with the foreign productions, this withholding tax is now
proposed to be collected from all TV channels airing such foreign produced
content.
96. It is also proposed that any person making payment for a foreign
produced advertisement shall collect withholding tax at the rate of 20% of the
payment. 
Budget Speech 2016-17

SALES TAX AND FEDERAL EXCISE DUTY:
RELIEF MEASURES (SALES TAX AND FEDERAL EXCISE)
Mr. Speaker,
97. Now I will present relief measures that are proposed to be
introduced in the Sales Tax and Federal Excise law during the current Budget:
- Exemption of sales tax on import of Laptops and PCs - In order to
promote information technology it is proposed that Sales tax may be
exempted on the import of Laptops and PCs. This step will also
promote genuine imports and will render informal and illegal imports as
uncompetitive.
- Exclusion of second hand and worn clothing from further tax levy
- Sales tax on second hand and worn clothing is currently levied at
cumulative rate of sales tax of 10%. In order to provide some relief in
the prices of second hand clothing which are used by the common
citizens, it is proposed to reduce the tax rate to 8%.
WITHDRAWAL OF FEDERAL EXCISE DUTY ON CERTAIN SERVICES
Mr. Speaker,
98. Federal Excise Duty at 16% is leviable on services such as
Advertisement on CCTV / Cable TV, Shipping Agents, Banking Companies,
Insurance Companies, Cooperative Financing Societies, Modarbas,
Musharikas, Franchise Services, Stevedores, Stock Brokers, Forex Dealers
etc. Provinces are demanding withdrawal of FED on such services as the
provinces are already charging sales tax on these services. SBP has also
endorsed the proposal in respect of banking services. It is proposed to
withdraw FED on these services where Provincial Sales Tax is payable.

REVENUE MEASURES (SALES TAX AND FEDERAL EXCISE)
Mr. Speaker,
99. Now I will present revenue measures that are proposed to be
introduced in the Sales Tax and Federal Excise law during the current Budget:
1) Abolition of zero-rated status of stationery items - Zerorating of stationery items is open to misuse. In order to prevent
the misuse, it is proposed that zero-rating on these items may
be converted to exemption.
2) Abolition of zero-rated status of milk - Milk, fat-filled milk and
preparations for infant use have been enjoying zero-rating
facility on supplies since the last so many years. As a result,
huge amounts of refunds are claimed by the dairy sector.
Despite this, the benefit of the facility is not passed on to the
consumers. Therefore, it is proposed that zero-rating on
preparations for infant use may be retained, while the zerorating on milk and fat-filled milk sold in retail packing is proposed
to be withdrawn. The exemption on milk and fat-filled milk will
remain intact.
FEDERAL EXCISE DUTY ON CEMENT
Mr. Speaker,
100. Cement is currently chargeable to Federal Excise Duty at the rate of
5% of the retail price. It is proposed to replace the current regime with fixed
rate basis at the rate of Rs. 1 per kg.
101. Increase in the rate of sales tax on import of mobile phones - In
order to stop mis-declaration and to bring the tax structure in line with market
prices, the rates of sales tax on mobile phones are being rationalized. The
existing sales tax rates of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 are proposed to be
increased to Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,500 for medium and high category mobile 
Budget Speech 2016-17
40
phones respectively. The rate of tax on low category mobiles will remain
unchanged at Rs. 300.
102. Enhancement of rates of Federal excise duty on cigarettes - In
order to enhance revenue from this non-essential sector, and to keep pace
with inflation and discourage cigarettes smoking amongst the public the rates
of FED on cigarettes are proposed to be increased in two stages with first
stage ending on 30th November 2016. The increase in tax rate will be about
23 paisa per cigarette for lower tier cigarettes and about 55 paisa per
cigarette for higher tier cigarettes.
103. Aerated Waters - The current rate of Federal Excise Duty on aerated
waters is 10.5%, which is lower than the standard rate of FED. In order to
generate additional revenues from this growing sector, it is proposed that the
rate of FED on aerated water may be increased to 11.5%.
SIMPLIFIED REGIME FOR TIER-1 RETAILERS
Mr. Speaker,
104. In order to simplify the procedure of payment of sales tax by Tier-1
retailers and to address their grievances, it is proposed that in addition to
existing regime, the retailers may have option of a simplified regime of
payment of sales tax at the rate of 2% of their total turnover.
105. Enhancement of rate of sales tax on certain ingredients of poultry
feed - Concessionary rates of Customs Duty and sales tax on major poultry
feed ingredients like soybean meal and vitamin premixes shall remain intact.
However, other ingredients that are subject to sales tax at the rate of 5% are
proposed to be subjected to sales tax at 10%.
106. Marble cutting and polishing industry - Currently, Marble Industry is
mostly unregistered and is not paying sales tax. The industry has agreed to
pay its share if the tax is collected through electricity bills. In order to bring this 
Budget Speech 2016-17
41
sector in the ambit of sales tax and encourage registration, it is proposed to
introduce sales tax on electricity consumption basis at the rate of Rs. 1.25 per
Kilo Watt Hour.
CUSTOMS DUTY
107. Now the proposals related with Customs are being presented before
the house:
TARIFF SLABS REDUCTION
Mr. Speaker,
108. High tariff barriers create hindrance in the integration of the economy
with the larger world markets. Twenty first century is the era of Global Value
Chains (GVCs). No single economy can compete in the world market without
significant Foreign Value Added (FVA) component. To open the economy to
world competition and to protect the vulnerable domestic sectors has always
been a challenging task.
109. Two years back, on the instructions of the Prime Minister, tariff reforms
process was initiated. As a result of the efforts of the Government, maximum
tariff slab of 30% was brought down to 25%, and the numbers of tariff slabs
was reduced from 7 to 6 in the budget for financial year 2014-15. Last year,
the highest tariff rate was further slashed to 20%, and the number of slabs
was reduced from 6 to 5.
110. This year the tariff slabs are being reduced from 5 to 4. The new
general slabs will be 3%, 11%, 16% and 20%. From next financial year, the
2% and 5% slabs will be merged in the new slab of 3%. This will reduce the
cost of import of more than two thousands items mostly machinery and raw
material and will pass on the benefit of Rs. 18 billion to the industrial sector of
the country. However, other items will continue to be subjected to customs
duty at the rate of 5% by shifting these items to the fifth schedule. 
Budget Speech 2016-17
42
Mr. Speaker,
111. Government is endeavoring to encourage the use of energy efficient
technology in the country. It is, therefore, proposed that customs duty may be
withdrawn on the import of essential raw material for the manufacturers of
LED lights in the country. The scope of duty free import of renewable energy
technologies is also being expanded and streamlined.
AUTO DEVELOPMENT POLICY 2016-21
Mr. Speaker,
112. Keeping in view the importance of automobile sector in the economic
development of the country, a new Auto Development Policy 2016-21 has
already been announced by the Government. In this budget, measures are
being taken to initiate the implementation of the policy. This will help
encourage the prospective investors to invest in this vital sector of the
economy.
INCREASE OF CD ON IMPORT OF BETEL NUTS AND LEAVES
Mr. Speaker,
113. Where the government is providing incentives and relief to the
agriculture and industrial sector and taking measures to protect the children
from malnourishment, the government is also striving to discourage the use of
those items which are considered health hazard. It is therefore, proposed that
Customs Duty may be enhanced from the current 10% to 20% and from Rs.
300/kg to Rs. 600/kg on the import of betel nuts and betel leaves respectively.

Concluding Remarks
Mr. Speaker
117. We have given the 4th Budget of the democratically elected
Government. This is a highly auspicious development for the country. We are
entering the fourth year of our tenure with poise, confidence and
determination. We have behind us an unmatched record of progress in almost
all facets of the economy – rising growth, contained inflation, fiscal discipline,
increasing tax collections, stable exchange rate, increasing reserves and a
fully protected external account. Even our worst critics have acknowledged
the stability that is unquestionably in witness in the economy. The process of
investment has started in earnest, both under and outside CPEC.
118. We are cognizant of the fact that what we have achieved is not fully
commensurate with the potential of our people. Indeed, our true goal is to
enable our people to realize their dreams and inspirations. We are building a
Pakistan where it would be possible for such dreams to be realized. We have
made investments that would rid the country of years old menace of
loadshedding. Where there would be enough gas to meet the rising demand;
sufficient number of schools, universities, dispensaries and hospitals to cater 
Budget Speech 2016-17
46
for the educational and health needs of our population. We are blessed with
world’s sixth largest and youngest population. It is not the destiny of our
people to live in darkness or be deprived of basic amenities of life. We are a
Islamic nation, and a responsible nuclear power. We need a strong and
prosperous economy. This is our final destination, for which we have laid a
very solid foundation. But the path to reforms is long and torturous, which is
traversed only by those nations that show consistency and determination.
This is exactly our resolve and we would fulfill its demands.
49. For sometime, I have been requesting political parties that our country
needs a Charter of Economy. You will agree with me that to achieve
sustainable growth, we need to agree on established principles that are not
influenced by political ups and downs. I would once again request all political
parties that they sit together to develop this Charter. On many occasions over
the past three years, it has been proven that we could resolve difficult issues
with mutual consensus. Therefore, if we sit together on this matter then a
consensus based Charter can be given a practical shape.
50. The Budget 2016-17, like its three predecessors, aims to consolidate
gains we have so far made and punctuate our journey to a rising growth
trajectory. Federal PSDP of Rs.800 billion and provincial investments of
Rs.875 billion will take public sector development spending to Rs.1675 billion,
which is nearly 5.7% of GDP. Together with investments in private sector, the
investment to GDP ratio will rise to significant level that will support the
achievement of the growth rate of 5.7% which will create job opportunities for
our youth. In addition, due to poverty alleviation programs, poverty will reduce.
51. Whatever we do is the realization of the Pakistan that was dreamt by
Quaid-e-Azam. On the occasion of the first budget in Karachi, in his speech
Quaid-e-Azam said “I do not have any doubt in my mind that a glorious future
is awaiting Pakistan when it would fully utilize the unlimited human and natural
resources. The path on which we are travelling is difficult at this time, but with
courage and steadfastness we have to build a strong and prosperous
Pakistan”. 
Budget Speech 2016-17

52. We believe in this vision of Quaid-e-Azam. With the ability of our
people no destination is unreachable. Shair-e-Mashriq and creator of the
vision of Pakistan believed in the abilities of our people and signaled this in
his poem:
Mr. Speaker,
53. I am grateful to this august house that has given me the opportunity to
present the next year’s budget. And I am also grateful to you and pray to Allah
that He makes things easy as they have been in the past years.
