Mr. Speaker,
1. As I rise to present the second budget of the democratic government, I
want to thank Allah (SWT) for remarkable mercies He has bestowed on us by
giving enormous success to the policies and initiatives we announced in our
first budget. This success is the outcome of a democratic process that has
allowed people to choose their representatives and they, in turn, are working
to achieve their aspirations.
2. When we started our journey, we were facing the most daunting task of
repairing a broken economy. We embarked on a very comprehensive agenda
of economic reforms aimed to reinvigorate the economy, spur growth,
maintain price stability, provide jobs to the youth and rebuild the key
infrastructure of the country. Prime Minister Mohammed Nawaz Sharif set a
rare example of foresight, courage and political sagacity when he did not shy
away from taking painful decisions; decisions that were surely unpopular but
imperative for restoring economic health of the country. Today, with the
blessings of Allah, I say in all humility that we have not only restored the
health of the economy but have put it firmly on the path of stability and growth.
I by no means, am claiming that we have achieved our highest goals,
however, I can gratefully and with humility, inform this House that Pakistan
today is much more strong, healthy and prosperous than where it was one
year before. But we need not be complacent with achievements so far.Weare
far from our destination. Therefore, we have to continue to strive and move
forward, so that we achieve the status and stature among the nation, which
we deserve, given our abilities. This is a national agenda and we hope that in
order to achieve this, both side of the Parliament shall guide and favor us with
valuable suggestions.
Review of Economic Performance 2013-14 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 2
Mr. Speaker:
3. I would like to place before this august House the following key
economic indicators, based largely on latest data, which point to an
unmistakable revival of the economy:
(a) Economic Growth, which had averaged around 3% in the
five years before our government, has been projected at
4.14%as per the revised estimates. This is the highest growth
in the last six years;
(b) Per Capita Income, which stood at $1339 last year is
projected to increase to $1386, showing a growth of 3.5%;
(c) Industrial Sector, which grew by a meager 1.37% during JulFeb last year, has registered a growth of 5.84%, aided by
increased availability of electricity and better management of
available gas supplies. This is also highest in the last six
years;
(d) Inflation, which had averaged around 12% in the five years
before our government, was recorded at 8.6% for Jul-May
2013-14, that too despite the fact that we had takendifficult
decisions to raise taxes and rationalize energy prices;
(e) FBR revenues, which had registered one of the poorest
performances of in the recent past of 3% growth in 2012-13,
are up by 16.4%, rising from Rs.1,679 billion to Rs.1,955
billion in the first 11 months of the current year;
(f) Fiscal deficit, which was registered at 5.5% during Jul-Apr
2012-13, has been brought down to only 4.0% for the same
period this year. Here I would like to remind that in the revised
estimates for 2012-13, we were told that the fiscal deficit will
be 8.8%. We had taken office only a few days earlier but even
then in the three weeks of June 2014, concerted efforts were
made to economize on spending. The result was that actual
deficit was brought down to 8.2%. This year, the target was to 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 3
reduce deficit to 6.3%, but we are achieving a deficit of 5.8%,
which is an excellent achievement;
(g) Credit to Private Sector, which was registered at
Rs.92.5billion during 1st July 2012 to 9thMay 2013has
increased to Rs.296.4 billion for the same period this year,
showing a growth of 218% and reflecting increased
investment activity in the private sector, thanks mainly to
reduced borrowings by the government, mainly from SBP,
which were completely eliminated from a level of Rs.417
billionlast to a negative Rs.11 billion during this year;
(h) Exports were recorded at $21billion during Jul-Apr 2013-14
compared to $20.1billion last year, showing an increase of
4.24%;
(i) Imports were recorded at $37.1 billion during Jul-Apr 2013-
14 compared to $36.7 billion last year and showing a marginal
growth of 1.2%. However, imports of machinery have
increased by an impressive 11% an indication of investment
activity;
(j) Remittances, which were recorded at $11.6 billion during JulApr 2012-13, rose to $12.9 billion for the same period this
year, showing an increase of 11.5%, which is remarkable and
for which I salute my expatriate Pakistanis for playing such a
critical role in country’s economy;
(k) Exchange Rate, which experienced some instability due to
speculative activity and initially declining reserves due to
heavy repayments due from previous IMF loan, has been
successfully stabilized and significantly appreciated
subsequently. The speculators had thought that government
would sit idly while they play havoc with the dollar. They had
pushed the rate to approximately Rs.111on 3rd December,
which was totally unacceptable, as it had no economic
justification. While dealing sternly with them we have
expended serious efforts to stabilize the reserves position and
also improved the basic economic indicators. Since 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 4
3rdDecember 2013, the rupee has appreciated by 11%. It has
been trading in the range of Rs.98-99 for nearly three months,
and this is the single most important indicator of economic
stability as it affects a large number of other variables like
prices and cost of production. A stable exchange is the
lynchpin of a stable economy;
(l) Foreign Exchange Reserves, which had declined to a
precarious level when in June 2013 SBP they stood at $6
billion, of which $2 billion were due to a swap that was
payable in August. More importantly, besides regular debt
servicing, a payment of $3.2 billion was due to IMF, bulk of
which in the first half of the fiscal year. On 10th February
2014, country’s reserves had further declined to $7.58 billion,
of which SBP reserves amounted to a meager $2.70 billion
and those of commercial banks amounted to $4.88 billion.
Many had predicted that Pakistan would soon default. It is
from such a precipice that we have pulled the economy back
and put it in on sound footing. For reasons I will be alluding to
in my speech, foreign exchange reserves of the country have
entered safe territory and no longer pose any risk to the
economy. Even though reserves at present stand at around
$13.5 billion, we will be pushing them to $15.0 billion, much in
advance of our target to achieve this level by 31stDecember.
(m) Karachi Stock Exchange Index, which stood at 19,916 on
11 May 2013, the day the elections were held, has
continuously scaled new heights and stood at 29,543 on 29
May 2014, showing an increase of 46%. Also, this increase
meant an increase of approximately 39% in market
capitalization both in rupees and dollars.
(n) Incorporation of New Companies, which was recorded at
3212 during Jul-Apr last year has increased to 3655 during
the same period this year, showing an increase of 13.79%; 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 5
4. In addition to above, we have achieved certain results that have eluded
the previous government for its five year term:
(a) Euro Bond: Every year, since 2007-08, a provision had been
made to raise foreign exchange resources through the
issuance of Euro Bonds, which were last issued in 2006 and
each year either no efforts were made as performance of the
economy did not warrant or once a team on the roadshows
aborted the attempt for lack of interest and demand for
Pakistan bond. And please note that this was an
exchangeable bond with equity in OGDCL, a company
registered and traded in London Stock Exchange. Allah has
been extremely kind in making our efforts remarkably
successful in the very first year of our government. After
achieving economic stability we immediately embarked on
raising resources from the international capital market. We
had set a modest target of $500 million. As we completed the
roadshows on 7th April 2014 and briefed investors about our
policies and results so far achieved, we received an
unprecedented response from them. Against our target of
$500 million, investors offered $7.0 billion, which meant
nearly 14-time oversubscription. Encouraged by this
phenomenal response, and keeping in view our pressing
needs for building reserves, we decided to accept $2.0 billion
of offers. The pricing was internationally competitive and
significantly better than the prices at which we are raising
resources domestically, even after accounting for possible
exchange rate adjustments. More importantly, the foreign
resources so raised have allowed us to retire domestic debt
that is more expensive, and enabled greater flow of credit
toward the private sector, as I have already noted.
(b) Resumption of Program Lending: For a long time, and
largely due to failure to implement the previous IMF program
the country was denied access to program lending both by 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 6
World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB). These
loans, particularly the cheap financing from the World Bank,
are given for budgetary support and augment foreign
resource availability for the purpose of balance of payments.
The high quality of economic management undertaken by the
government has inspired the confidence of both these
institutions and we have succeeded in securing $1.4 billion
from these two institutions in the two key sectors namely
energy reforms and competitive and growth support reforms.
(c) Auction of Spectrum License:Anothernotable achievement
of our government is the successful auction of radio spectrum
license of 3G and 4G. This is again an area where budget
provision of Rs.50-79 billion has been consistently made
since the budget of 2009-10 without any success. Even
though we had raised the budgetary provision to Rs.120
billion we succeeded in realizing our goal. Not only have we
achieved our target price, through a built in incentive
mechanism that prompted two of the four winners to make
upfront payment of 100% price, we still have two more
licenses that we will sell during the next fiscal year. All of this
we have achieved with total transparency, competition and in
full view of the world. Pakistan has lagged behind in
introducing new technologies but we have removed this
obstacle. Those who have purchased these licenses are
extremely bullish in their assessment of Pakistan’s growth
potential. To understand the potential of what is in store for
economic growth from this sector, it may be noted that even
though we have more than 130 million cell phone subscribers,
we have less than 10% penetration of broadband (data
transmission), which will make all smartphone connected to
internet and thereby all users to take advantage of global
connectivity. A new wave of economic growth is likely to be
spurred from the introduction of this technology in the country. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 7
(d) Revival of the Privatization Program:The privatization of
public sector assets, based on strategic partnership or
through divestment in the capital market, was one of the key
reforms we had proposed in our Manifesto and duly reflected
in the budget strategy announced last year. This is again an
area that lied dormant and unattended for last many years, as
the previous government, despite making an announcement
and short-listing 65 entities for this purpose, could not
succeed. We have reinvigorated the program with
considerable effort and injected new vigor in its execution, as
per the program charted out by the previous government.
Before the close of the calendar year, we would be divesting
government shares in HBL, UBL, ABL and partially increasing
the public listing of PPL and OGDCL. We have also appointed
financial advisers for various public sector corporations where
we plan to establish strategic partnership with private sector
investors. These are those corporations that are burdening
the pubic sector resources by their constant bleeding. The
proposed strategic partnership will transform them into
profitable organizations and remove their burden on the
exchequer. Furthermore, besides bringing much needed
foreign investment in the country, this process will help
lowering the debt burden of the country and make more
resources available for investing in the poverty reducing
programs in accordance with the privatization law. I would like
to assure this House that while pursuing this program, our
government will not let the interests of workers and
employees of public sector corporations compromised. Their
welfare and rights will be duly protected.
(e) Import of LNG: Yet an important area that eluded others has
been the plan for import of LNG in the country. Our present
supplies barely meet 50% of our demand. Import of LNG is
critical for our industry, power sector and fertilizer production.
We had invited private sector to invest in a terminal for 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 8
receiving 200 MMCFD of LNG to be expanded to 400
MMCFD. We have succeeded in awarding, again through a
transparent and competitive process, the work of building the
terminal at the Port Qasim. The work on the terminal has
started and within one year the flow of gas is likely to begin.
We have also rolled out the process of procuring 3.5 million
tons of LNG from the international market, which is again
done through a competitive process.
5. From what I have stated above, it can be seen that it is a picture of an
economy that is not facing any threat of instability. It is in fact poised to take
off toward a sustained path of growth. Investments are re-bounding,
confidence is building and people are forming expectations of a better
tomorrow. It is indeed the results of a consistent and credible policy regime
that the government has fashioned and practiced.
Mr. Speaker:
6. You would recall that when presenting the first budget of the
Government, I had outlined the vision that is guiding our economic policies.
The six elements of the vision were:
(a) promotion of trade and investment and protection of economic
sovereignty;
(b) making the private sector primary engine of economic
development;
(c) public investment to cater for building a strong infrastructure of
roads, highways, railways, ports, water, hydro-power and
related infrastructure;
(d) equitable sharing of the burden of development by eliminating
the culture of tax exemptions and concessions and recovering
cost of public services to ensure their sustainable supplies;
(e) practicing austerity and frugality in public expenditures and
containing them within the available resources; and, 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 9
(f) protecting the weak and vulnerable segments of population
both by insulating them from inflationary pressures as well as
giving cash grants to mitigate the adverse impact of economic
adjustment and reforms.
7. We have scrupulously followed the vision we have set out for the
economy. In every aspect of the vision, we have acted as we promised. The
brief description of our performance, given above, and what will be highlighted
later in this speech, exemplifies the faithfulness and seriousness with which
we are working to realize this vision. This is a reflection of a responsible
representative government that is answerable to Parliament and the people
who have voted it to office. And as we move to the second year of our
government, the new budget will continue to reflect the same spirit and
commitment as embedded in this vision.
Main Elements of Budget Strategy
Mr. Speaker
8. I would now like to draw your attention to the main elements of the
budget strategy we are adopting for the next fiscal year.
(1) Reduction of fiscal deficit:We will continue to reduce the fiscal
deficit still further from 5.8% of GDP to 4.9% of GDP;
(2) Raising Tax Revenues:Although I will give details in the
second part of the speech, this reduction in deficit will be
achieved through a combination of better tax collection and tight
expenditure policy.
(3) Arresting Inflationary Pressures:We have successfully
warded off the inflationary pressures that were inevitable due to
difficultdecisions we took in the first budget. As I noted, inflation
has been kept firmly in the single digit territory. We gave more
than Rs.20 billion in subsidy to avoid passing on the petroleum
price increases. In the last one year, in nearly 8 months either 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 10
prices were unchanged or decreased. The following
developments will further strengthen the inflationary outlook
going forward:
i. Continued reduction in deficit;
ii. Borrowings from SBP were eliminated during this fiscal
year and next year these will be further brought down.
iii. The shift toward foreign borrowings we have contracted
carry an average cost of less than 5%, which is
considerably lower than the domestic cost that is
averaged more than 12%. This will save us Rs.26 billion
annually in interest payment and will help reduce the cost
of debt servicing;
iv. Regular price monitoring is being undertaken with a view
to ensure adequate supplies of all commodities and
maintain stable prices. Apart from the ECC that regularly
reviews price situation, a price monitoring committee
comprising all federal and provincial ministries and
departments headed by Finance Minister also
meetsevery two months for more coordinated approach
toward maintaining price stability. Provincial
Governments have established extensive networks of
Juma and Itwar bazaars all across the country. These
bazars provide additional avenues of purchasing
essential items at considerably lower prices than those
prevailing in the markets. Remedial measures are taken
whenever shortage of an essential commodity is noticed.
Tariff, taxation and trade policy instruments are used to
stabilize supplies and prices by making appropriate
adjustments in duties, sales tax and income tax.
(4) Continued Focus on Energy Crisis:The 4Es we have given in
our Manifesto refer to economy, energy, education and
extremism. Thus energy occupies a central position in our
program. We had inherited an energy sector that was at brink of
total collapse. Load shedding was running at 16 hours in urban 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 11
and 20 hours in rural areas. A gigantic circular debt of more than
Rs.500 billion had stranded a sizable amount of capacity for
want of liquidity. Critical projects, such as Neelum-Jehlum and
Nandipur, were delayed or nearly abandoned due to sheer
negligence. We were not deterred by the enormity of the
challenges facing the sector as we realized that without fixing
this sector no realistic hope of economic revival couldbe made.
We settled the circular debt and freed up and added some 1700
MW in the national grid. These initiatives have paid off as the
provisional figures of national accounts show that the valueadded in the power sector increased by 3.72% as against a
negative growth of 16.33% last year. But more importantly, we
are working on a comprehensive program to add more power,
improve energy mix to reduce the need for tariff increase, attract
private sector investment and invest in transmission and
distribution system to improve the efficiency of the entire power
sector. I will be mentioning these initiatives in the context of the
development plan;
(5) Exports Promotion: An emerging challenge on the horizon is
the growth in exports critically needed to support a stable
balance of payments over the medium to long term. Since 2000-
01, our exports have grown at the rate of 8% compared to a
growth rate of 13% for imports, leading to a large trade gap in
the country. During the same period, the export to GDP ratio has
declined from 13% to 10% whereas the import to GDP ratio has
increased from 15% to 19%. This rising imbalance in the trade
account has been significantly corrected by a remarkable growth
in remittances, which have grown by nearly 25% during this
period, with the result that our current account has been stable
in recent years. Not surprisingly, the terms of trade for the
country during this period have also continuously worsened,
eroding competitiveness of our exports. This is not a satisfactory
state of affairs. Our trade balance, largely due to lackluster
growth in exports, is not consistent with our economic potential. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 12
There is no escape from facing the challenge of stemming the
declining trend in country’s export to GDP ratio by giving a big
push to the exports and redirecting our energies for enabling our
industry and agriculture to create an exportable surplus in the
country. To this end, this budget will be laying the basic
foundations for a major thrust on export promotion. I will
announce a number of initiatives aimed at giving boost to our
potential exports.
(6) Creating New Jobs:We need to create jobs to absorb the rising
number of young men and women entering the job market. As I
said previously, much of this activity has to take place in the
private sector, as our primary job is to provide an enabling
environment for the private sector to undertake investments.
The 3G-4G technologies, successfully introduced by our
government, will spur growth not only in rolling out this facility
but enabling other users to improve productivity and efficiency in
their operations. A detailed study on the impact of 3G-4G
technology on employment has estimated some 900,000 jobs
will be created in the next four years.Investments are
encouraged through other policies, most notably by reducing
government borrowings and making more credit available for
private investments. On our part, a major increase in
development spending is planned during the year. PSDP will be
increased from Rs.425 billion during 2013-14 to Rs.525 next
year, an increase of nearly 24%. As I will enumerate shortly,
these funds will be invested in major projects of infrastructure
that will not only create immediate jobs but will go a long way in
promoting more investments in the private sector.
(7) Raising Investment for Growth:Investment remains a
challenge for the economy. The plans we have in this regard are
at an advanced stage of preparation and work on some mega
projects is just starting. Even the phenomenal increase in the
flow of credit to private sector, which I noted earlier, has not
been fully reflected in investment figures projected on the basis 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 13
of data for 9 months. There would be a significant acceleration
in investment in the country in months and years ahead. For the
first time in recent history of the country we are investing the
fullest available development outlay of Rs.425 billion. This is a
remarkable achievement in view of the fact that we have made a
fiscal adjustment of 2.4% during the year. Frequently, in the
past, whenever such adjustment was made it was essentially
made by cutting development spending. We have broken this
tradition. Those who have constantly criticized the government
for slow development spending did not realize that the new
government needed time to reset priorities in the development
plan to ensure that such projects are undertaken that are
consistent with the economic program of the government that
enabled it to win the confidence of the people. We have done
this and with that the pace of development spending has
accelerated.
(8) Public Debt Management: The composition of public debt has
witnessed major changes in past few years with increased
reliance on short-term domestic debt owing to lower external
debt inflows, which entails high rollover and refinancing risk.
Besides, the effective cost and stock of external public debt
increased due to rapid depreciation of Pak Rupee in the recent
past. The present government has taken immediate corrective
measures to manage its public debt portfolio effectively. Key
elements of our debt management policy are:
− A Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (2014-18) has
been developed to lengthen the maturity profile and reduce
the refinancing risk along with sufficient provision of external
inflows to relieve the pressure on domestic resources and to
enable private sector to access more credit from the banking
system;
− To broaden the investors’ base and have a liquid
government securities market, trading of Treasury
Billscommenced on the stock exchanges. This has provided
an additional investment channel to retail investors. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 14
− Pakistan successfully tapped international capital markets
after a gap of 7 years, which highlights investors’ confidence
on country’s leading economic indicators, external finances
and structural reforms undertaken by the present
government.
− The program loans received from multilateral/bilateral
development partners during 2013-14 as well as financing
raised from international capital market in the form of Euro
Bond will not only assist in lengthening of maturity profile of
public debt, there are also strong
concessionalelementassociated with these loans i.e. low cost
and longer tenors. The annual cost saving on these loans,
as mentioned earlier, is around Rs.24 billion as compared
with the domestic financing.
(9) Protecting the Poor: Reaching out to the poor is a major policy
objective of our government. The main intervention we have
designed for this purpose is the National Income Support
Program (NISP) which consists of Prime Minister’s Youth
Program and Benazir Income Support Program. Of this BISP
remains the biggest effort to help the poor through cashtransfers. The following achievements have been made in this
regard:
i. In 2008, I was the one who made an allocation of Rs.34
billion for BISP. However, when we inherited this program
last year, only Rs.40 billion were spent. Given our
commitment to the welfare of the poor, we immediately
raised the funding to Rs.75 billion, while adding an
important component for schemes under the PM’s Youth
Progam. We are further enhancing this allocation to
Rs.118 billion, representing approximately200% increase
since 2012-13;
ii. Until 2012-13, the cash-transfer program was reaching
out to 4.1 million families, which will have taken to 4.8
million during the current year. Next year we will be
increasing the number of beneficiary families to 5.3
million, showing an increase of 29% since 2012-13; 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 15
iii. The monthly stipend under the program was initially set at
Rs.1000, which continued for five year, until we enhanced
by 20% last year to Rs.1200. This year we announce
another increase of 25% by raising the monthly stipend to
Rs.1500. Therefore, in the last two years, we have raised
the monthly stipend by 50%
iv. Besides the above, an allocation of Rs.21 billion has
been provided to fund the special schemes under the
Prime Minister’s youth program announced previously,
most of which are now fully functional and those that will
be announced in this budget.
v. We are proud of this support that we are providing to our
vulnerable and young people. We owe it to them; it is
their own resources that we are managing in trust and
making sure that in their state of vulnerability we are
there to help them. I would also like to emphasize that we
are not promoting a culture of dependency for the poor.
We have adopted a methodology that constantly watches
the economic state of recipients and there is a very
structured process through which families are graduated
from being recipients to become economically
independent. This program is therefore a program only to
help families under need and encourage them to gain a
life that does not finally depend on such assistance.
(10) Strengthening Social Safety-net Programs: A large number
of social safety-net programs are scattered across different
ministries and departments and it is not evident if these
programs are fully synergized with each other. To strengthen
these programs it has been decided to establish a high-powered
Task Force to undertake a detailed review of the programs’
performance, assess their effectiveness, and to determine that
these programs are optimally operated and no overlapping in
their scope and work is present. Based on the report of the Task
Force a new policy will be formulated that would allow more 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 16
coordinated delivery of social safety-net services by the
government.
(11) Development & Promotion of ICT Sector:- The Government is
fully cognizant of the importance of Information &
Communication Technology and its potential role in trade,
foreign direct investment, women empowerment, employment,
education, national competitiveness and ultimately the economic
growth. We are making adequate provisions in this budget for
the development and promotion of the this vital sector, namely:
• Establishment of Universal e-Telecentres: In order to
improve public access to ICT services such as NADRA
facilities, biometric verification devices for issuance of
SIMs, e-facilitation in health, agriculture, commerce,
governance, learning etc. and to generate local
employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, Universal
Services Fund (USF) shall fund a mega program for
establishment of Universal e-Telecentres. In the first
phase, 500 Telecentres will be established in the four
provinces and Islamabad. An investment of approximately
Rs.12 billion shall be made on this program over the next
three years.
• Improved Connectivity of Remote Areas: This year USF
shall invest another Rs.2.8 billion in its ongoing program
whereupon optic fiber cable is being aggressively laid to
provide connectivity to outlying areas particularly in
Baluchistan, FATA, rural KPK and other parts of country.
Additionally, Rs.3.6 billion have been earmarked out of
USF to be spent on Rural Telecommunications Program.
All these efforts shall result into rapid rollout of next
generation ICT services in the remote areas.
• Prime Minister’s ICT Scholarship Program: This
Program aims at providing the highest quality ICT
education opportunities at top universities to the students 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 17
belonging to rural and semi urban areas. This year, Rs.125
million have been allocated out of National ICT R&D Fund
to provide 500 scholarships in a transparent manner.
Medium-term macroeconomic framework
Mr. Speaker
9. As the in past, our budget strategy is embedded in a three year
medium term macroeconomic framework, the main features of which are as
follows:
(a) GDP growth to gradually rise to 7.1% by FY 2016-17.
(b) Inflation will be maintained in single digit throughout the
medium term.
(c) Investment to GDP ratio will rise to 20% at the end of medium
term.
(d) Fiscal deficit to be brought to down to 4% of GDP by 2015-16
and maintained at this level afterward.
(e) Tax to GDP ratio will be increased 13% by the year 2016-17
(f) Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves will be increased to
more than $22 billion at the end of 2016-17.
10. Encouraged by the performance in the first year in office, we are
confident that these ambitious targets will be achieved with consistent and
resolute determination to remain on-course on the path of reforms. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 18
Development plan
Mr. Speaker
11. I would now present some highlights of the development budget,
focusing mainly on the sectors that will contribute most to the economic
development.
 Water
12. One of the greatest assets bestowed on this nation by the Almighty
(SWT) is the abundance of water resources. Pakistan has got one of the
largest irrigation networks in the world. After initial big investments in the
development of water resource we have stopped adding to our water storage
capacity while the existing dams have accumulated silt over the years.
13. The most important sub-sector claiming resources in our development
plan is the water sector, where we are investing Rs.42 billion for projects in
various parts of the country. A project that will be the future life-line of
Pakistan is the DiamirBhasha Dam, which will store4.7 MAFof water and
generate electricity of 4500 MW. We have provided Rs.10 billion for land
acquisition during the year and have kept a provision of Rs.15billion for
completion of the land acquisition process. We are committed to make this
dam a reality and construction work will start soon on the site. Water projects
in Baluchistan are the second most important focus of water sector
investments comprising construction of delay action dams, flood dispersal
structures, canals and small storage dams. Major focus is on completing the
long delayed projects such as Katchi Canal (DeraBugti and Nasirabad),
Naulong Storage Dam (JhalMagsi),Extension of Pat Feeder Canal to
DeraBugtiandShadi Kaur Dam (Gawadar). In Sindh, the projects
ofRaineeCanal(Ghotki and Sukkur), extension of Right Bank Outfall Drain
from Sehwan to sea will be undertaken. In Punjab Ghabir Dam (Chakwal),
and in AJK, completion of raising of Mangla Dam will be executed. In Khyber 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 19
Pakhtoonkhwa, Palal, Kundal and Sanam Dams (Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa) and
in FATA, KurramTangi Dam (North Waziristan), GomalZam Dam (South
Waziristan) will be undertaken. Besides, numerous schemes of lining of
water-courses will be undertaken in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa, Sindh and Punjab
to reduce water wastage together with flood protection and drainage schemes
all over the country. Moreover, new water sector projects are being initiated
which include a series of small dams across Baluchistan and Khyber
PakhtoonkhwaincludingBasool Dam in Ormara and Makhi Frash Link Canal in
Thar and Channelization of NullahDeg in Punjab.
Power
Mr. Speaker
14. Another sub-sector that is getting our utmost attention is the power
sector. Widespread power shortages have badly damaged our industrial
sector and added to the sufferings of the common people. Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has devoted personal attention to the process of reforms and
investments in this sector. We have taken a number of steps to address
structural problems of the sector including reduction in system losses,
improvement in recoveries, elimination of theft and settlement of inter
corporate circular debt. However, our real focus is on developing additional
resources of energy so as to permanently overcome the problem of
shortages. Therefore, in keeping with last year’s practice we have allocated
the largest amount of resources to create more economical capacity in the
country. During the current year a sum of Rs.205 billion will be invested in this
sector. The projects included in the program include Neelum-Jehlum Hydro
Power Project (969 MW), Diamir-Bhasha Dam and Hydropower Project (4500
MW), Tarbela Fourth Extension Project (1410 MW),Thar Coal Gasification
Project (100 MW), Chashma Civil Nuclear Power project (600 MW), Two
Karachi Nuclear Coastal Power Projects (2200 MW) with Chinese assistance,
KeyalKhawarHydroPower Project (122 MW), AllaiKhawar Hydro Power
Project (122 MW), Combined Cycle Power Projects at Nandipur(425 MW) and
Chichoki Malian (525MW), Refurbishment and Up-gradation of Generation 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 20
Units of Mangla Power Station, Up-gradation of Guddu Power Project (747
MW gas-based), conversion of oil based power projects to coal at
Muzaffargarh and Jamshoro (3,120 MW), transmission network to evacuate
power from Wind Power Projects in Jhimpir and Gharo, interconnection of
Chashma Nuclear III and IV, interconnection of Thar Coal based Engro (1200
MW) and massive allocations to improve the transmission lines, grid-stations
and distribution systems. We have expended unusual efforts to make the
dream of Dasu Hydropower Project a reality. TheWorldBank will soon be
approving $700million for financing this critical project that will add more than
4500 MW of power after completion. We are designing innovative ways to
mobilize the requisite finances for constructing this project within the shortest
possible time.
15. Addition of a number of hydel projects, coal based plants, wind energy
and nuclear projects will correct the energy mix to provide cheap electricity to
the people of Pakistan while improvement of the transmission and distribution
system will reduce the system losses. The drive against energy theft will
further reduce the burden on the common man.
 Highways
Mr. Speaker
16. Pakistan has significant importance in regional connectivity. It provides
crucial North to South and East to West corridors to three regions and some
of the fast-growing economies in the world. But in order to benefit from this
natural advantage, Pakistan needs to develop state of the art rail, road and
energy infrastructure.
17. Leaders have to see through the future. Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharifrecognizedin 1990 that Pakistan will not progress rapidly unless it
develops an extensive network of motorways to link distant parts of the
country. Therefore, he launched his vision of a modern communication
system, which could not be materialized due to negligence of a number of
intervening governments. But we are picking up the pieces from where we left 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 21
off and we intend to complete most of the North to South Corridor projects
during the next four years. Broadening his vision of connectivity the Prime
Minister along with his Chinese counterpart has developed the vision of PakChina Economic Corridor that would link Kashgar and Gawadar through both
motorways and railways. It is not difficult to imagine the phenomenal
economic development that would be engendered by such an epoch-making
project. Various components of the project have been undertaken starting this
year.
18. The premier project that would transform the south-north corridor,
linking Sindh to Up-country through a rapid transit mode, is the 959 KM
Karachi-Lahore motorway project for which Rs.25 billion have been allocated
for land acquisition this year and Rs.30 billion in the next year’s development
budget. This will enable complete land acquisition for the project. Construction
work on 276 KM Lahore to Khanewal Section, 387 KM Multan to
SukkurSection, 296 KM Sukkur to Hyderabad Section and 136 KM Hyderabad
to KarachiSectionwill start soon and will be undertaken on public-private
partnership basis. It is estimated that the project will be completed before the
term of the present government expires. On the other hand, work on the
remaining portions of 892 KM Gawadar-Ratodero Motorway has been
expedited and the works on 200 KM long Gawadar-Turbat-Hoshab Section
have been prioritized by meeting all its financial requirements. For northern
connectivity, work on for construction of 460 KM Raikot-Havelian-Islamabad
Section of the corridor will also be starting as well as for widening of the
Khunjrab-Raikot Section of the Karakorum Highway.
19. There are many more highway projects included in the development
plan. This include184 Km Faisalabad-Khanewal Section and 57 KM
Khanewal-Multan Section of M4. In addition, allocations have also been made
for a number of crucial bridges and tunnels to open up unconnected areas.
These include accelerated completion of Lowari-Tunnel, Lipa Tunnel in Lipa
Valley, a bridge on River Chenab near Sultan Bahoo, Baba Farid Bridge near
Pakpattan, Syedwala Bridge on River Ravi near Nankana Sahib, and a bridge
on Indus River to connect N5 and N55. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 22
20. In order to address the problem of urban congestion, allocations have
been made in the current budget for the Peshawar Northern-Bypass, Karachi
Northern Bypass, Lyari Expressway, Dualization of Sukkur Bypass, and
Lahore Eastern Bypass. Moreover Ratodero, Dadu-Sehwan Road and RakhiGaj-Bewala East-West road are also being constructed to improve
connectivity.
21. This is an extensive program in the highways sector comprising 74
projects of motorways, highways, bridges, tunnels, and regional roads and a
sum of about Rs.113 billion has been kept in the budget for this purpose.
Numerous job opportunities will be created while undertaking the above
projects.
Mr. Speaker
Railways
22. Railways is supposed to provide cheaper, faster and convenient mode
of passenger and freight transport. But despite inheriting a large railway
network spread across Pakistan, we have mismanaged the railway assets to
the extent that nobody would chose to use it as a first option. Railway was
headed for near extinction when PML N took over last year. Marginalization of
Railways was simply unacceptable to us because the world over, rail transport
is regaining its lost glory as more investments are made and faster trains are
built for both passenger and goods transport.
23. In the budget for 2014-15, Government has allocated amounts for
doubling of track from Khanewal to Lalamusa, covering a major portion of the
north-south mainline. Remaining tracks will also be doubled in coming years.
24. Similarly allocations have been made for rehabilitation of track from
Karachi to Khanpur and Khanpur to Lodhran. Allocations have also been 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 23
made to strengthen and rehabilitate 159 weak railway bridges. These
measures will improve the speed and reduce travel time.
25. Modern railways depend heavily on technology that increases
efficiency and reduces accidents. However we have not upgraded our system
to benefit from technological advancements. In the budget for the current year
the Government has allocated significant amounts for mechanization of track
maintenance, replacement and improvement of signaling system and
provision of a centralized traffic control system.
26. Pakistan Railways was in severe shortage of engines and bogeys
when PMLN took its charge. We have given special attention to these
shortages and huge investments in locomotives and rolling stock have been
made in the current as well as next year’s budget. Allocations have been
made in the current budget to add more than 500 engines to the system
through procurement and repair. This will address the issue of shortage of
engines.
27. Similarly around 1500 new wagons/bogeys are also being arranged.
Pakistan Railways is taking these steps to improve the travelling experience
of its customers. In order to further enhance the convenience of travelling with
Pakistan Railways, this budget has allocated special amounts to renovate and
upgrade railway stations in various cities.
28. In order to make Pakistan Railways profitable, the Government has
planned to offer increased freight services. Allocations have been made in this
budget to procure additional wagons for freight operations and a feasibility
study is being commissioned to study the possibility of a dedicated freight
corridor.
29. All these steps have been taken to revive the existing services of
Pakistan Railways. In addition to the revival of the existing system, the Prime
Minister of Pakistan has a vision for high tech, modern and viable railways.
Therefore, some entirely new and bold steps are being taken to take Pakistan 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 24
Railways to new heights. Huge investments are being made under the China
Pakistan Economic Corridor, which will bring fast, modern and reliable
railways to Pakistan.
30. Similarly urban railway is being introduced initially in Karachi and
Lahore. Allocations have been made in the Federal budget to revive the
Karachi Circular Railway while the Government of Punjab has planned to
introduce a modern metro rail in Lahore. This is a new beginning and
InshaAllah the people will feel the difference in service delivery of Pakistan
Railways in the coming years.
31. A path-breaking project of Islamabad-Murree-Muzzaffarabad Rail Link
is being initiated and a new company with the name of Kashmir Railways is
being established to construct and manage this exceptional project in the
scenic area of Galyat and Kashmir. This project will open new avenues in
tourism and travel pleasure and this would prove to be a special gift of
Pakistan Muslim League to the nation.
32. In this budget, we have allocated Rs.77 billion for 45 development
schemes and pay & pensions of railway employees. Private and international
investments are expected during the course of the financial year in this sector,
as well.
Human Development
Mr. Speaker
33. People are the most precious resources of any nation. Therefore we
consider the expenditures on human development as investments as they lay
the foundation of future growth at an accelerated pace. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 25
34. Initiatives that will be undertaken for the promotion of this sector are as
follows:
(a) A sizeable allocation of Rs.20 billion has been made for 188
projects of the Higher Education Commission, which will support
development plans of different universities all over the country. It
may be noted that on the current side also a hefty allocation of
Rs.43 billion is made for HEC. Thus a combined outlay of
Rs.63billion will be made for higher education. The combined
allocation represents about 10%increase, which is sizeable
considering the tight fiscal conditions prevailing in the country.
(b) Health sector service delivery has been fully devolved to the
provincial governments. But the Federal Government is
cognizant of its responsibilities to support the provinces in
eradication of deadly diseases, regulation of the health sector
and coordination to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). Therefore the current budget allocates Rs.26.8 billion
for the health sector programs. Our major focus will be polio
eradication. An emergency plan has been made for this purpose
and the Federal Government will work closely with the provincial
jurisdictions to eradicate polio from Pakistan.
(c) Additionally the budget will also fund the Expanded Program of
Immunization (EPI), National Maternal Neonatal and Child
Health Program, National Program for Family Planning and
Primary Healthcare and several national programs for
prevention and control of important diseases such as blindness,
TB, Hepatitis and AVN Influenza.
(d) Most importantly, funding for the provincial programs for
population welfare has been kept at Rs.8.2 billion. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 26
SPECIAL INITIATIVES
Mr. Speaker
35. Having stabilized the economy and announced a significant
acceleration of investment program in the public sector let me turn to some
special initiatives our government is announcing in order to meet the special
needs of exports, in general, and textiles, in particular, commerce & industry,
agriculture and housing. These sectors are central to economic development
and there recent dormant performance has been a cause of concern.
Accordingly, we have decided to give impetus to development in these
sectors.
Exports Promotion
36. I had earlier highlighted the weaknesses in our exports performance
that have emerged over the last decade. We must arrest this low exports
growth and declining export to GDP ratio. The following measures are being
adopted for promotion of exports:
(a) Setting up of EXIM Bank of Pakistan (Specialized DFI):The
Government has decided to set up the Export-Import (EXIM)
Bank of Pakistan to enhance export credit and reduce cost of
borrowing for exporting sectors on long term basis and help
reduce their risks through export credit guarantees and
insurance facilities. The bank will provide liquidity to exporters.
Its authorized capital will be Rs.100 billion while the initial Paidup Capital will be Rs 10 billion. Legal framework for the
establishment of the Bank will be developed through an Act of
Parliament.
(b) Exports Refinance Facility (ERF): The Government, through
the State Bank of Pakistan, has arranged to reduce its mark-up
rate on exports finance from 9.4% to 7.5%, which will bring it in 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 27
line with such rate prevailing in the countries competing with
Pakistan which will reduce the financial cost of exporters by 2%;
(c) Long Term Finance Facility: The Government, through the
State Bank of Pakistan has arranged to reduce its mark-up rate
on long term financing facility for 3-10 years duration from
around 11.4% to 9%w.e.f 1st July 2014 which will reduce
financial cost of exporters by 2.4%;
(d) Removing Anti-exports bias in Imports: A tariff rationalization
program, being announced in the present budget, will gradually
remove the anti-export bias in country’s tariff policy and make
exports more competitive.
(e) Revitalizing Export Development Fund (EDF): The EDF was
established through the contributions of the exporters for the
promotion of exports. However, over the years projects
undertaken with Fund’s resources were not entirely helpful to
exports. The EDF Board has been reconstituted and its
organization is overhauled with a view to make it more
responsive and effective for the benefit of exporters.
(f) Establishment of Pakistan Land Port Authority:It has also
been decided to establish Pakistan Land Port Authority to
transform land ports into efficient facilitators of trade while being
responsive to risks such as security issues, smuggling and
human trafficking. This measure will help Pakistan to increase
its exports through the overland route where numerous
opportunities are offered by regional countries and connectivity
to northern and western corridors;
Textiles Package
37. Textiles sector is the mainstay of country’s exports as it accounts for
more than half of country’s exports. Its performance has been affected due to
poor crops, delays in introduction of quality seeds and regulatory approvals
for introduction of Bt cotton, widespread energy shortages, numerous local 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 28
taxes and levies, high cost of finance and restricted trade regimes adopted by
importing countries.
38. A meaningful export promotion policy will not be possible unless we
provide the much-needed support for the development of this sector.
Accordingly, the following package of support and incentives is provided for
the textile sector:
(a) Draw-back for local taxes and levies to be given to exporters of
textile products on FOB values of their enhanced exports if
increased beyond 10% (over last year’s exports) at the following
rates:
o Garments 4%
o Made ups 2%; and
o Processed fabric 1%
(b) Mark up rate for Export Refinance Scheme of State Bank of
Pakistan is being reduced from 9.4% to 7.5% from 1st of July
2014.
(c) The Expeditious Refund System is being improved and a fast
track channel for manufacturers-cum-exporters is being created.
I have already directed FBR to dispose of all their pending Sales
Tax refund claims before 30th September 2014. In future, all
admissible refund claims of exporters shall be disposed off
within 3 months, if not earlier.
(d) The textile sector value chain will be given protection as per the
study carried out by National Tariff Commission (NTC). This will
provide a predictable tariff regime for the foreseeable future.
(e) Textile industry units in the value added sector would be
provided Long Term Financing Facility (LTFF) for up gradation
of technology from State Bank of Pakistan at the rate of 9% for
3-10 years duration.
(f) Textile sector enjoyed duty free import of machinery under
textile policy 2009-14. This facility will end on 30th June 2014
(SRO-809). It is proposed that in view of the need to take full 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 29
advantage of GSP plus facility, this concession would be
allowed for another two years.
(g) Use of Bt Cotton will be promoted by expediting regulatory
approvals. To enable availability of quality seeds requisite
amendments in Seed Act 1976 will be made and Plant Breeders’
Right Act will be promulgate.
(h) A new vocation training program will be launched to train
120,000 men and women, over the five year period, for skills
required in the textile sector, especially in the value added
sector such as garments and made ups. The scheme will have
following features;
• Total Cost: Rs 4.4 billion
• Monthly stipend of Rs.8,000 per month
• 3 months training program
• To be run through TEVTA institutes and textile industry
Agriculture
39. Agriculture occupies a central position in country’s economy as besides
contributing more than 21% to GDP it houses more than 65% of population
and employs nearly 45% of our labor force. It has also great export potential
but little has been done to this end, except a few token efforts to provide some
support for transport of agriculture produce. The key to improving agriculture
productivity is access to seeds, water, credit, research and extension serves,
markets and better pricing. Many of these responsibilities have been devolved
to provinces and we are urging provinces to play their role in this regard.
However, the federal government remains actively engaged with provinces in
developing policies required for maintaining national food security and
undertaking research in basic agriculture activities. With a view to develop a
national policy for the long-term sustainability of agriculture on profitable basis
it has been decided to establish a National Food Security Council. The council
will be responsible for ensuring policy coordination across provinces and 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 30
relating to productivity improvements, market reforms, value addition and
prices that ensure stable incomes for farmers.
40. Within the areas where Federal Government can help the following
package of incentives and support are being announced for the agriculture
sector:
(a) Credit Guarantee Scheme for Small and Marginalized
Farmers:The government is introducing Credit Guarantee
Schemein order to encourage banks for financing to unbanked
small farmers. Government, through the State Bank of Pakistan,
will provide guarantee to commercial, specialized and micro
finance banks for up to 50% loss sharing. The scheme will cover
farmers having up to 5 acres irrigated and 10 acres non-irrigated
land holdings. It will benefit 300,000 farmer households/families
with a loan size up to Rs.100,000. Total disbursement under this
scheme will be Rs.30 billion.
(b) Reimbursement of Crop Loan Insurance Scheme (CLIS)
Premium:Farming is one of the most vulnerable occupations in
the face of natural calamities, climatic changes and plant
diseases. In order to cover the risk to various crops the
Government has introduced the crop loan insurance scheme for
farmers with landholdings of 12.5 acers. From this budget, the
scope of CLIS premium reimbursement is being enhanced up to
25 acres. All farmers obtaining loans for production of 5 major
crops are eligible to benefit from this scheme. 700,000 farmers
households/families will benefit from this scheme. Total budget
cost of the scheme is Rs.2.5 billion.
(c) Livestock Insurance Scheme: Pakistan is a major livestock
and milk producer. But the majority livestock ownership is at
subsistence level which increases the risk of loss. In order to
mitigate the risk of losses of small livestock farmers, the
Government is introducing the Livestock Insurance Scheme for
all farmers getting financing for up to 10 cattle. The scheme will 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 31
cover livestock insurance in case of calamity and disease. The
scheme will benefit 100,000 Livestock farmer
households/families. An allocation of Rs.300 million has been
made in the current budget for the scheme.
(d) Reduction in Sales Taxes on Tractors:The previous
government levied sales tax on tractors which w.e.f. 1st January
2014 stands enhanced to 16%. This has adversely affected local
buying of tractors. To encourage use of tractors by the growers
it is proposed that the sales tax will continue to be charged at
the reduced rate of 10%.
(e) Establishment of Commodity Warehouses/Receipt
Financing Mechanism: In order to develop a mechanism for
establishment of quality warehouses, silos, cold storages and
cold chains, and linking it to finance through warehouse receipt
system, the Government, through the State Bank of Pakistan, is
helping to develop a regulatory mechanism for establishment of
a warehousing clearing system and introducing special
incentives for potential investors. This scheme will cover all
existing or new warehouses, silos and cold storage for farmers,
aggregators, traders and other value chain players. Under the
scheme, Rs.1 billion will be invested as GOP-equity for
establishment of a PPP-company to regulate and monitor this
system. Additionally, State Bank has decided to provide LTF
facility for establishment of storage and cold-chain facilities.
(f) Agriculture Credit:Credit to agriculture is critical for enhancing
famers’ productivity. We are conscious of the difficulties faced
by the farmers in getting credit through the loan sharks. During
the year, our Government has increased credit availability to
agriculture sector from a targeted Rs.315 billion to Rs.380
billion. The State Bank has now decided to enhance overall
credit to Rs.500 billion for the year 2014-15. With increased
credit availability, and various insurance schemes, farmers’
problems with respect to access to financial sector will be
addressed to a large extent. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 32
(g) Incentives for Processing Industries of Special Areas: In
some parts of the country, such as in MakranDivision,GilgitBaltistan, Swat District and FATA regions, agriculture produce
suffers great losses for lack of processing and transport
facilities. To encourage establishment of processing units at
such places, Government is introducing a policy to support
processing projects in Makran,GilgitBaltistan, Swat Valley and
FATA. These units will enjoy duty and tax-free import of
machinery not locally manufactured and will also have access to
SBP LTF facility and 5 years tax holiday. Additionally, a
concessionary long-term financing facility shall be provided to
them through State Bank of Pakistan.
(h) Airfreight Subsidy:Governmenthas also decided to provide
50% airfreight subsidy for horticulture produce from GilgitBaltistan.
Housing
41. Housing is a basic need of the human beings and the government
owes it to its people to facilitate provision of housing in the country. The
following initiatives are being planned to promote housing sector in the
country:
(a) Low Cost Housing Guarantee Scheme: The government has
specially designed a program to provide housing credit to low
cost housing units to enable the poor to have their own houses.
Banks will provide loans of up to Rs.1 million and financial
institutions, under this scheme while the government will
guarantee 40% of the portfolio amount. The scheme will cover
all areas of Pakistan and 25,000 loans worth Rs.20 billion will be
provided through this innovative method of supporting low and
middle-income families.
(b) Mortgage Refinance Company:A Mortgage Refinance
Company is being established with a broad shareholding of the 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 33
Government of Pakistan, Commercial Bank, Development
Finance Institutions, Multilaterals and others for this purpose, to
generate long-term liquidity for housing finance. Total paid up
capital of the company would be Rs.6 billion. The company will
provide refinance facilities through purchases of loans from the
financial institutions engaged in loan origination and packaging
them for sale to long-term investors. Government ofPakistan will
invest Rs.1.2 billion in the equity of the company.
(c) Revival and Restructuring of HBFC:House Building Finance
Company Limited has been the premier for providing housing
finance to low and middle-income families. There is an urgent
need to rehabilitate this institution to enable it to play its
important role in the housing sector. The following actions will be
taken for this purpose:
 Immediate formation of Board of Directors;
 Improvements in efficiency and capacity;
 Simplification of procedures;
 Major drive to recover non-performingloans.
 Provision of new resources;
(d) PM Low Cost Housing Scheme:Inaddition to above, a
provision of Rs.6 billion has been kept in the budget for PM’s
low income housing scheme.
42. Prime Minister’s Health Insurance Scheme:At present, only a
quarter of population in Pakistan is covered for health care costs, whereas
74% of Pakistanis, mostly poor and from rural areas, have to pay for such
expenditures out of their own pockets. Urgent corrective measures warranted
to rectify this situation. Accordingly, with the involvement of provincial
governments an insurance scheme is being designed that will help the
poorest segments of population obtain health insurance for tertiary care and
special diseases, iftheprovincial governments provide the coverage for the
primary and secondary care. A provision of Rs.1 billion is being kept in the
budget for launching of this scheme on pilot basis, which will be rapidly
replicated in in increasingly larger number of districts. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 34
Pakistan Development Fund
Mr. Speaker,
43. In the past, an effort was made to establish the forum of Friends of
Democratic Pakistan (FODP), which did not produce any tangible results.
With the grace of Allah, we have established a company titled Pakistan
Development Fund Limited, for which resources of Rs.157 billion have been
arranged. The Company will provide financing to key infrastructure projects
and promote Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for this purpose.
Islamic Banking
Mr. Speaker
44. We have revived the efforts to promote Islamic banking and financial
system in the country. A Committee has been constituted for this purpose
comprising prominent Ulema,bankers, economists and government officials,
which will finalize its recommendations by 31st December, 2014 suggesting
measures to enhance the current share of Islamic banks in the overall
banking assets, remove difficulties in expanding the outreach of Islamic
banking, enlarge the set of Islamic financial products, design instruments for
financing government fiscal operations on Shariah principles and identify
steps required to ensure wider application of Islamic financial system in the
country. A Center of Excellence in Islamic Economics is also being
established to further the research work in Islamic Banking and Finance.
Budget Estimates
Mr. Speaker,
45. Now I turn towards the estimates of revenues and expenditures for the
next fiscal year. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 35
46. Gross revenue receipts of the federal government for 2014-15 are
estimated at Rs.3,945billion compared to the revised figures of Rs.3,597
billion for 2013-14, showing an increase of 10%. We have set an ambitious
target for tax collections, as without collecting more taxes we cannot hope to
increase development spending that is crucial for economic growth. I shall
share more details of this in Part-II of my speech.
47. The share of provincial governments out of these taxes will be
Rs.1,720 billion as compared to Rs.1,413 billion revised estimates for 2013-
14, showing an increase of about 22%. Net resources left with the federal
government will be Rs.2,225billion compared to the revised estimates of
Rs.2184 billion for last year. Federal Government recognizes that the
provincial governments have increased responsibilities of social sector service
delivery under the new arrangements. Therefore, we have raised the level of
provincial transfers over the last year from Rs.1,215 billion to Rs.1,720 billion,
which is an increase of 42%, in orderto enable them to improve the social
services and law and order for the people of Pakistan.
48. Total expenditure for 2014-15, is budgeted at Rs.3,937billion compared
to the revised estimates of Rs.3,844 billion for 2013-14, showing meager
increase of 2% which is much lower than the inflation rate. The budgetary
needs of our Armed Forces as per their needs have been duly provided in the
budget. Viewed within the overall increase, the government expenditure in
real terms is actually contracting instead of expanding. This approach of
gradually increasing the revenues and reducing the expenditure will make us
self-reliant and sustainable. The current budget is estimated at
Rs.3,130billion for 2014-15 against a revised estimate of Rs.2,935billion for
2013-14, showing an increase of 6.6%. However, the development budget
has been adequately funded in order to meet the investment requirements of
a growing economy. Against a revised estimate of Rs.425 billion for PSDP,
we have budgeted it at Rs.525 billion showing an increase of nearly 24%. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 36
Budget deficit is considered as the main culprit behind economic instability as
it leads to both inflation and exposes the country to external vulnerabilities. As
I noted earlier, we are making significant progress in reducing deficit, as it was
brought down to 5.8% from 8.2% last year. This year we are reducing it to
4.9%. The federal deficit is projected at Rs.1,711billion for 2014-15 compared
to the revised estimate of Rs.1,660 billion for last year. By requiring surplus of
Rs.289 billion from the provinces, compared to a revised deficit of Rs.183
billion last year, we have projected an overall fiscal deficit of Rs.1422 billion
for 2014-15.
49. Mr. Speaker
50. This shows a gradual trend of reducing fiscal deficit marking
responsible behavior of the government towards fiscal and economic stability.
We will continue this practice and further reduce the deficit to just 4% in the
coming years. This will further stabilize the economy.
 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 37
PART-II
Mr. Speaker,
51 Allow me to begin Part II of my speech, which relates to taxation
proposals.
52 Our government had inherited perhaps the worst possible tax collection
performance during the fiscal year 2013-14. Against a budget target of
Rs.2381, we were given the revised collection figure of Rs.2050 billion, which
meant a massive reduction of Rs.331 billion from the budget estimate.
However, what was most shocking is the final collection of only Rs.1946
billion, another shortfall of Rs.104 billion from the revised target. This
amounted to a meager growth of 3% over tax collections during 2011-12, the
lowest ever nominal growth.
53 We have started picking pieces from such dismal performance and, as
I noted earlier, our tax collections are up by 16.4%. While this is quite
respectable under the circumstances of an economy going through a
stabilization phase, we need to exert a great deal more efforts in pushing the
tax revenues of the country which are commensurate with both our
development ambitions and needs of fiscal sustainability.
Principles of Taxation Proposals
54 At the outset, I would like to lay before the House the basic principles
and objectives guiding the taxation proposals included in the Budget 2014-15.
These are as follows:
a. The share of direct taxes in overall taxes shall be increased;
b. The incidence of tax measures will be on those outside the
tax net and those already in the net will be protected;
c. The non-compliant taxpayers will have to bear a cost of noncompliance, which will raise their cost of doing business; 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 38
d. The tax regime will be simplified and inequities created by
SRO based concessions and distortionary provisions will be
removed through a phased plan.
e. The tax revenues will be increased so as to improve the Tax
to GDP ratio.
f. Without compromising the basic character of simplified and
distortion-free tax regime, appropriate incentives will be
provided for facilitating foreign investment in the country,
development of less developed areas, agriculture sector etc.
55 These are very sound principles of taxation that have guided our
proposals. Let me turn to specific proposals.
Phased Elimination of SROs
56 Because of a large and complex regime of concessionary SROs,
developed gradually over many years, a convoluted and multi-layered
structure of duties and taxes has emerged that continues to bedevil the
taxpayers and creates inequities in the system. These SROs not only cause
huge loss to national revenue but also, more crucially, distort the level playing
field and breed corruption.
57 Over the last many years, a number of SROs were issued at the
behest of interest groups having the power and influence to manage changes
in the tax structure for their benefits. These exemptions serve as entry barrier
for SMEs, give preferential treatment to big stakeholders, and have created
factually a licensing regime that grants approvals and sanction quotas.
Mr. Speaker,
58 A high-powered committee approved by thePrime MinisterMuhammad
Nawaz Sharif diligently reviewed and extensively deliberated on the entire
concessionary regime on the basis of principles developed after broad-based
consultations. The committee, which included representatives of trade and 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 39
industry recommended phasing out of the concessions over a period of three
years, which the Honorable Prime Minister has approved.
Mr. Speaker,
59 This is a momentous occasion in the history of the tax reforms in this
country because privileges granted to influential classes over the years are
being abolished. We are taking a giant step towards evolving a simple,
transparent and an equitable tax structure. Now those small and medium
entrepreneurs, who do not have the financial resources and capacity to go
through the complex and cumbersome procedures for obtaining concessions,
shall have access to level playing field. A major source of discretion and
malpractices is being done away with.
Mr. Speaker,
60 The thrust of our government is to promote growth and equity in the
economy. Our proposed tax measures are another step in this direction. We
believe that the engine of growth has to be the private entrepreneurship and
all measures are being taken to promote it across the board i.e. from SMEs to
the large industrial undertakings. The tax regime would help promote the
growth paradigm. We do not want to stymie growth. Accordingly our proposals
will not put any additional burden on economic activity. We shall only tax the
income and expenditure of the affluent class. Our vision is to make Pakistan
self reliant by generating our own resources. Our aim is to increase the tax-toGDP ratio, reduce budget deficit gradually and thereby divert more resources
for development, which would engender growth and bring its benefits to the
public.
Mr. Speaker
61 Our government does not believe in arbitrary and one-sided decisionmaking. In conformity with our philosophy we undertook an extensive and
intensive consultative process before formulating our tax proposals. Economic 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 40
Advisory Council, FPCCI, Chambers of Commerce & Industry,
representatives of all major trade bodies, Anjuman-e-Tajiran, chambers of
commerce and industry, professional organizations and economists were
invited to give their proposals and suggestions for the current budget and their
recommendation were duly considered and incorporated so far as possible in
the proposed measures.
Relief Measures
Mr. Speaker
62 I will now highlight some of the relief measures to be introduced
through Budget 2014-15:
a. Relief for Capital Market: A star performer of Pakistani
economy during the FY 2013-14 has been the stock market.
The rate of capital gains tax was to increase from 10% to
17.5% with effect from 1st July 2014. However, to ensure
continued stability in the stock market, it is proposed that with
effect from 1st July 2014 CGT rates shall be 12.5% for
securities held up to 12 months and 10% for securities held
for a period which is between 12 to 24 months, whereas the
securities held for more than 24 months shall be exempt from
CGT.
b. Investment Incentives for Foreign Direct Investment: To
achieve the vision of an industrialized Pakistan in the
foreseeable future we want to attract both domestic and
foreign investment into the manufacturing sector. This august
House would recall that the Prime Minister had earlier
announced a special package for promoting investment in the
manufacturing, construction, housing and mining sectors for
the domestic investors. In order to attract Foreign Direct
Investment in manufacturing, construction and housing
sectors, it is proposed that corporate tax rate be reduced to 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 41
20% if the investment is in a new industrial undertaking or a
construction or housing project to be set up by 30th June 2017
and at least 50% of the total project cost in the form of equity
through FDI. This will also generate employment, which is
one of our major challenges.
c. Incentive for Joint Ventures between Companies and
AOPs: The non-resident companies investing in Pakistan had
to create a joint venture with a local company and the contract
receipts of such joint ventures were taxed as final tax in the
hands of the joint venture/AOP and thus the non-resident
companies could not enjoy their status of being a nonresident. To facilitate such arrangements for the nonresidents, it is proposed that if one member of the joint
venture is a company, it should be taxed separately at the
applicable rate while the individuals should be taxed as an
AOP separately.
d. Incentives for Agriculture: To promote agricultural sector
we are proposing concessions for encouraging tunnel farming
by removing customs duty on import of plastic coverings and
mulch film, anti-insect net and shade net. Sales tax on high
irrigation equipment and equipment for green house farming
is also proposed to be exempted.
e. Reduction in the Corporate Tax Rate: Business community
has been agitating that corporate tax rates are quite high and
act as deterrent to the promotion of corporatization. In
accordance with the already announced policy it is being
proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate by one percent.
Therefore, for tax year 2015, the corporate tax rate shall be
33%.
f. Reduction in the Withholding Tax on Marriages and
Functions: Last year the adjustable advance withholding tax
@ 10% was introduced on persons arranging marriage and
other functions for the purpose of documenting expenses
made by persons out of the tax net. At present, the rate of 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 42
advance income tax on functions and gatherings is 10%.
Marriage functions at shadi halls are becoming the norm.
Therefore the 10% rate is creating hardship even for the
middle class. It is proposed to reduce the rate from 10% to
5%.
g. Relief for the Disabled Persons: The Government feels that
the disabled persons need empathy and special
consideration. It is being proposed to reduce tax liability of
such persons having income up to Rs.1 million by 50%.
h. Reduction of Taxes on Telecommunication Sector:
Telecommunication has become a necessity for all segments
of society. Telecom Services are highly taxed as both FED
and GST on Services continue to be imposed on them. In
order to simplify the tax regime, it has been decided to
withdraw FED from those provinces which have imposed GST
on Telecom Services. In areas where FED shall continue to
be collected, the rate is proposed to be reduced from 19.5%
to 18.5%. Furthermore, it has been decided to reduce the rate
of Withholding Income Tax on telephone services from 15%
to 14%.
i. Removal of Income Support Levy: Income Support Levy
Act was promulgated through the Finance Act, 2013. The aim
was to mobilize additional resources for the economically
distressed persons. However, the public at large did not
accept this measure as it was considered harsh and was
perceived as double taxation. The Government has decided
to accept the demand and it is proposed to repeal the Income
Support Levy Act, 2013.
Income Tax
Mr. Speaker, 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 43
63 Now I come to our Income tax proposals to enhance revenue and
resultantly increase tax-to-GDP ratio.
64 As I said earlier, our thrust is to focus on making the affluent classes
contribute proportionately more to the exchequer and at the same time to
make the non-compliant citizens to pay more tax than the compliant
taxpayers. In the case of income tax the following proposals are presented:
a. Advance Tax on First and Business Class Airline Tickets:
It is proposed that Airlines may collect advance tax @ 3% on
the sale of first class and club/executive class air tickets if the
passenger is a compliant taxpayer (i.e. those who filed their
Income Tax returns for the preceding tax year), and 6% tax if
the passenger is a non-compliant person. The passengers
travelling through the economy class shall be exempt from
this tax to ensure that working classes and students travelling
to foreign destinations are not burdened by this measure.
b. Advance Tax on Purchase of Immovable Property: Real
Estate sector is attracting a major chunk of investment in an
attempt to make quick profits largely through speculative
buying and selling. The investment in this sector, unless it
leads to construction, is unproductive and needs to be
channelized to more productive sectors. To document and
bring into tax net the real estate transactions it is proposed
that an adjustable advance tax be collected on purchase of
immovable property. The proposed rate of tax is 1% for
complaint taxpayers and 2% for non-compliant persons.
However, properties with value less than Rs.2 million and
schemes introduced by the government for expatriate
Pakistanis will be excluded from this provision. Similarly, the
rate of adjustable capital gains tax on sale of immovable
property is proposed to be enhanced from 0.5% to 1% for the
non-compliant persons. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 44
c. Advance Tax on Electricity Bills over Rs.100,000 per
month: To ensure due contribution from the rich and to
discourage consumption, it is proposed to collect adjustable
advance tax @ 7.5% on the monthly bill of Rs.100, 000 and
above from the domestic electricity consumers.
d. Higher Advance Tax on Interest Income and Dividends:
For the persons who are non-compliant, it is proposed that
5% additional adjustable advance tax be deducted from them
on payment of dividend and interest. However, they can claim
adjustment of the additional tax paid if they file return. The
additional tax on interest shall not be deducted in case of
people earning income on interest up to Rs.500,000 in order
to avoid hardship to low and middle-income earners.
e. Higher Advance Tax on Cash Withdrawal by Non-filers:
Similarly, the non-compliant shall have to pay additional tax
on cash withdrawals at 0.2%, additional tax on booking with
manufacturers or registration of vehicles.
f. Higher Advance Tax on Car Registration by Non-filers:
The non-compliant shall have to pay a higher rate of tax at the
time of registration and payment of token tax on motorcars
and SUVs.
g. Removal of Inequities: There are certain distortions and
inequities in the tax system. The tax structure favors choice of
one entity over another. In this regard, distortions and
inequities in the mutual fund industry and other corporate
entities are proposed to be removed.
h. Taxation of Accounting Income: In corporate cases,
taxable income is usually far less than accounting income.
The difference is the result of careful tax planning to avail all
possible avenues of tax avoidance allowable technically. An
alternate corporate tax @ 17% is proposed to be imposed on
accounting income. The companies shall be taxed at ACT or
corporate tax whichever is higher. Facility of carrying forward 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 45
ACT up to 10 years and exclusion of exempt income is also
proposed.
i. Removal of Tax Loopholes: Tax on certain classes of
income was being avoided because of loopholes. Taxation of
bonus shares by companies and bonus units of mutual funds
and modarbas was different than that of dividend. This
anomaly is now being corrected.
j. Tax Rates for Services: At present rate for deduction of tax
on services are 6% and 7% for corporate and non-corporate
taxpayers respectively. Considering that persons providing or
rendering services usually enjoy high profit margins due to
low costs, the existing rates are considered lower. Hence, to
rationalize, it is proposed to enhance tax rate on services to
8% in corporate cases and 10% in other cases.
k. Changes in Final Tax Regime: Persons under final tax
regime (FTR) file only statements without accounts. Actual
income earned in such cases is not ascertainable. Moreover,
FTR is liable to misuse as persons having other sources of
income also file statements only. To enforce returns and
accounts, it is proposed that existing rates of tax deduction or
collection in certain cases such as commercial importers,
resident and non-resident contractors, service providers,
exporters, petrol pump operators and commission agents
shall be applicable only in case returns are filed by them
otherwise they shall be charged higher rate of tax.
l. Application of Tax on Foreign Institutional Investors:
Currently, the foreign institutional investors neither file returns
nor their tax is collected on capital gains. It is therefore
proposed to bring FIIs under the withholding tax regime. This
measure will broaden the tax net.
m. Mandatory Requirement of NTN: Further measure to
broaden the tax net is a proposal to make obtaining of NTN a
compulsory condition for seeking commercial/industrial
electricity and gas connections. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 46
Sales Tax and Federal Excise
Mr. Speaker,
65 The government has made a conscious policy decision to enhance the
contribution of direct taxes, which are progressive taxes, and gradually reduce
the burden of indirect taxes, which affect the common man. Therefore, you
will be pleased to know that no new tax has been imposed in case of sales tax
and federal excise duty.
66 In case of sales tax and federal excise duty, since last budget for 2013-
14, the government’s main objectives are to broaden the tax base and
increase the cost of non-compliance for those who remain outside the tax net,
to remove distortions and anomalies and to promote automation in order to
reduce interaction between tax payer and tax collector. Some of the steps
being taken in this regard through this budget are:
a. Simplified Sales Tax Regime for Retailers Tier-I: Because
of a variety of reasons, most of the retailers are still not in the
tax net. Previous governments made many attempts to
register the retailers, but did not succeed. After carefully
studying the issue, carrying out in-depth analysis and holding
consultations with representatives of retailers, we have
concluded that most of the retailers are willing to pay their due
share of taxes, but only want a simple and easy method of
doing so. Consequently, the retailers have been divided into
two tiers or categories. The first tier comprises the following:
1. Those retailers who operate as part of national and
international chain stores; or
2. Operate in air-conditioned shopping plazas; or
3. Have machines for credit or debit cards; or
4. Have monthly electricity bills in excess of Rs
50,000. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 47
These retailers will be required to pay sales tax in the normal
regime and to keep electronic cash register of approvedspecifications in order to record their transactions. Another
important challenge of bringing the high-end retail trade is
how to incentivize the consumers to demand a GST paid
receipt from the retailer. In order to do so we shall not only
launch an aggressive outreach program to educate the
taxpayers but shall also launch a periodic prize scheme
based on the GST paid receipt.
b. Simplified Sales Tax Regime for Retailers Tier-II: All
remaining retailers will fall in the second tier. For these, we
are introducing the simple mechanism of payment of sales tax
due through their electricity bills. Thus, retailers having
electricity bills of less than Rs.20,000 in a month shall be
charged only 5% of the bill as sales tax on retail sales, while
those with higher bills shall be charged 7.5% as sales tax on
retail sales.
c. Sales Tax on Domestic Sales of Export Industries: The
government desires to encourage exports. But at the same
time, the facility meant for exporters should not extend to
domestic sales, otherwise it will create distortions in the
market. SRO 1125(I)/2011 was issued in order to encourage
the five major export-oriented sectors – textiles, leather,
carpets, surgical and sports goods. However, under this SRO,
even imported finished goods were enjoying concessionary
rates of sales tax. Because of this notification, there was a
great disparity between the concessionary rates of sales tax
on imported finished goods of these five sectors sold in the
local market against the standard rate. This was leading to
distortion, evasion and malpractices. Accordingly, import of
finished goods of these sectors are proposed to be charged to
sales tax at standard rate, because they are meant for local
consumption by affluent classes and do not contribute to
exports. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 48
d. Rationalization of Sales Tax on Steel Sector: The steel
sector had been paying fixed sales tax at the rate of Rs.7/unit
of electricity up to February 2013. But this rate was reduced
to Rs.4 per unit of electricity without any rationale, which is
much below the normal rates. I am pleased to announce that
the steel sector has expressed its resolve to come forward
and contribute to the national cause, and all stakeholders
have agreed to revive the rate from Rs.4 to Rs.7 per unit of
electricity. The Government has also accepted their demand
to collect withholding tax of their purchases through their
electricity bills @ Rs.1 per unit of electricity.
e. Increase in Taxes on Tobacco: Pakistan is a signatory to
WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC),
which demands increase in prices and taxes of tobacco to
discourage consumption. In this regard taxes on tobacco are
being increased as specified in the Finance Bill.
Customs
Mr. Speaker Sir
67 I will now present the proposals relating to Customs, which are as
follows:
a. Exporters Facilitation: At present, six different facilitation
schemes are available for export sector. It has been felt that
complexity and multiplicity of these schemes creates
problems for exporters. Therefore, we have decided to
introduce a consolidated Export Facilitation Scheme. The
scheme will be implemented after broad-based consultation
with exporters.
b. Reduction in Maximum Rate of Tariff and Tariff Slabs:
High customs tariff rates not only create barriers for trade
liberalization, but lead to malpractices at operational level. 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 49
Our Government has decided to reduce the maximum tariff
and number of total slabs. As a first step towards tariff
reforms, maximum rate of 30% is being abolished, bringing
down the number of slabs to 6 and the highest tariff to 25%.
However, luxury items consumed by wealthy segment of
society are being subjected to regulatory duty equivalent to
the above facility.
c. Minimum Import Duty: At present, 40% of imports are totally
exempt for customs duty. For addressing the structural flaw in
tariff and improving assessment and documentation, 0% slab
in tariff is being substituted by 1%. However, socially sensitive
items like petroleum products, fertilizers, and all food items
etc. are being kept at 0% rate, through inclusion thereof in a
new schedule to the Customs Act.
Tax Reforms Commission
Mr. Speaker,
68 During our deliberations and consultations in the budget making
exercise we have received couple of detailed proposals on reform and
rationalization of General Sales Tax and other taxes. I am grateful to FPCCI
and other representative bodies of business for their detailed suggestions in
this regard. In fact there is a need to carry out an in-depth analysis and review
of the entire tax policy and tax administration in the country so that we may
organize them along the contemporary needs. Accordingly we have decided
to establish a Tax Reforms Commission in the country with the objective of
undertaking such an exercise. The Commission would comprise public
finance experts, practitioners, businessmen, tax lawyers and retired civil
servants. The composition and terms of reference of the commission will be
announced shortly.
 
Budget Speech 2014-15
Draft: June 2014 50
PART-III
Relief measures for government employees, pensioners and labor
Mr. Speaker
69. As you know, we are still in the stabilization mode as we are focusing
on reducing public expenditures. However, it is imperative that we do the bare
minimum that is possible within the limited resources available especially for
lower grade employees. Accordingly, the following measures are announced:
(a) A 10% ad-hoc relief will be allowed to all federal government
employees with effect from 1st July 2014;
(b) A 20% increase will be allowed to those employees in Grade-1
to 15 drawing fixed medical allowance of Rs.1000 per month;
(c) A 5% increase will be allowed in conveyance allowance to those
employees working in Grade-1 to 15;
(d) The post of superintendent is being upgraded from Grade-16 to
Grade-17;
(e) One pre-mature increment will be allowed to employees of
Grade-1 to 4.
(f) For welfare of the labor class, and in line with the increase in
pay of government employees, the minimum wage rate is also
being increased from Rs.10,000to Rs.12,000.
70. Last year I had raised the minimum pension for government employees
from Rs.3000 per month to Rs.5000, representing an increase of 67%.
Considering the difficulties faced by low pension employees, I am announcing
a further increase of Rs.1000 in minimum pension to make itRs.6000. This
means that the minimum pension has been doubled since 1st July, 2013. A
10% increase in pension will also be allowed to all retired federal government
employees.

Concluding Remarks
Mr. Speaker,
71. I have announced a budget of hope and aspirations. We had started
this journey under the most challenging circumstances. The achievements we
have made within a period of less than one year are remarkable. The
economy has been set in a stable direction. It was not too long ago that some
false prophets of doom, both international and local, had predicted that
Pakistan’s economy will default and collapse in the month of June 2014. Allah
has enabled us to prove them patently wrong.
72. All honest and impartial stakeholders are convinced that a serious,
clean and purposeful economic environment is finally in place in Pakistan.
This is the most fundamental requirement of a growing and prospering
economy. Policy-making is nothing more than signaling, since it is the people
who do the real hard work. Unambiguous and credible signals have gone all
across that Pakistan is fully fit for doing business.
Mr. Speaker,
73. I have laid the budgetary proposals before this august House. In the
end, I have only one request to make through your good self to the honorable
members of the House that they should rest assured of our determination,
honest intentions and our ever-lasting commitment to the national goals &
targets. They are well aware that the prosperity of a country can be assured
only through the peace and stability. The country which is in the grip of
terrorism for the last one decade, now craves for peace and political stability.
Civilized nations address their issues through constitutional means. We will
open-heartedly welcome any positive remarks, criticism and suggestion aimed
at bringing about rectifications & improvements. I say this full conviction that
instead of gathering in squares, intersections and street, let’s sit in this House
and solve our problems. This nation has paid a heavy price for long
dictatorships. Nothing positive can ever chaos and lack of peace. Now this
